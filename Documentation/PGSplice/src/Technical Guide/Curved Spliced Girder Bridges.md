Curved Spliced Girder Bridges {#tg_curved_spliced_girder_bridges}

PGSplice has robust geometric modeling capabilities. The roadway alignment is a critical element in defining the overall geometry of the structure.

Curved spliced girder bridges are easily modeled with PGSplice, however, must be small enough that torsional effects are negligible.

Friction loss at the angle point between precast segments is taken into account during the time-step analysis.
