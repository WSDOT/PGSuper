Project Criteria {#ug_project_criteria}
==============================================
Project Criteria controls most every aspect of the analysis, design, specification compliance check, and load rating. It controls the edition of the LRFD specification to be used, the allowable stresses, the loss calculation method, creep and camber parameters, allowable strand stresses, load factors, deflection criteria, design and analysis options and more.

The Project Criteria is defined in the Project Criteria library. Generally, a bridge owner such as a Department of Transportation will create configurations that set up the project criteria in such a way that it reflects their policies and practices. Select *Project > Project Criteria* to choose a particular project criteria to use in your bridge project.

> NOTE: Bridge owners will typically create configurations that set their project criteria as the default.
