==============================================
Parameters that control debonding of strands are defined on this tab.

Debonding Strand Limits (5.11.4.3)
----------------------------------
These parameters are used to check debonded sections to ensure that local stress concentrations at debond locations are excessive

Item | Description
------|---------
Maximum total debonded strands | Enter this value as a percentage of the total number of permanent strands
Maximum debonded strands per row | Enter this value as a percentage of the number of permanent strands in a row
Maximum debonded strands per section | These values limit the number of strands that can be debonded at a given longitudinal location. Enter both a total number and a percentage of the total number of debonded strands. The number of debonded strands will be limited to the greater of the two values.
