Haunch and Camber {#ug_library_dialogs_girder_haunch_and_camber}
==============================================

Haunch Design Parameters
-----------------------
These parameters control how the slab haunch is designed and evaluated in specification checks.

Item | Description
-----|-------------
Minimum Fillet | Enter the minimum permissible depth from the bottom of the slab to the top of the girder. Note that this value is only applicable to spread spaced girders. For adjacent giders, the minimum fillet is always assumed to be zero.
Minimum Required Haunch Depth at Bearing Centerlines | When checked, the haunch depth at bearing centerlines is compared to the input value.
Excessive Haunch Depth Warning Tolerance | Defines the tolerance for issuing a warning that the haunch depth is too deep. A deep haunch depth is not a structural problem, but you may be wasting material.
