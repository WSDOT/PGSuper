Interface Shear
----------------

Item | Description
-----|----------------
Total interface shear width reduction | The interface width considered to be engaged in shear transfer per LRFD 5.7.4.3 is reduced by the specified amount. When the deck system consists of stay-in-place panels one-half of this value is used for exterior girders and this value is not used for interior girders. This parameter is typically used to reduce the interface width because of intentionally smooth finish and bond breaker at the extremities of top flanges to facilitate deck removal.
