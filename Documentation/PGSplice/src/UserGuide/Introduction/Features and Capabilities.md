Features
---------
PGSplice has an extensive list of features. Here is a short list:
* Specification compliance checking for the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications
* Load Rating, including automatic load posting analysis, for the AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation
* Customizable project criteria including overrides and deviations from AASHTO provisions
* *Bridge-centric* user interface
* Detailed, graphically enhanced reports
* Wide variety of graphical results
* Customizable for all state departments of transportation
* Girder stability analysis for lifting and hauling

Capabilities
-------------------
A wide variety of bridge configurations can be modeled. Here is a short list of the modeling capabilities:

* Complex alignments including horizontal curves with transition spirals, vertical curves, and superelevation transitions.
* Modeling of spliced girder bridges with variable depth cantilever pier segments, drop-in field segments supported by strongback hangers, temporary erection towers, and multi-stage post-tensioning
* Multiple span bridges with simple, integral, and continuous boundary conditions
* Physical models of interior piers
* Complex framing plans including flared (non-parallel) girders and different number and type of girder in each span
* Sidewalks and pedestrian live loads
* User defined vehicles
* Non-linear time-step analysis using time-dependent material models from AASHTO LRFD, ACI 209, and CEB-FIP.
