Construct Segments {#ug_dialogs_construct_segments}
==============================================
Select segments that are constructed during this event and define timing properties.

Item | Description
-----|--------------
Segments to be constructed | List all of the segments locations. Segments with black text have not been assigned to an event. Segments with gray text are assigned to a different event and can be moved into this event.
Segments constructed during this activity | List of the segments constructed during this activity.
[>] and [<] | Move segments between the two lists
Time from strand stressing to release | The elapsed time between stressing the prestressing strands and imparting the force onto the precast segment. This time is used to compute initial relaxation losses.
Age of the concrete at prestress release | Age when the concrete is considered to have sufficient strength to take the pretensioning force. This is the age of the concrete when it reaches a strength of f'ci.
