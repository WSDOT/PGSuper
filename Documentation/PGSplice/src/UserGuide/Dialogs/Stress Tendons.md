==============================================
Select the tendons to be stressed during this event.

Item | Description
-----|--------------
Tendons to be stressed | List of all the tendons. Tendons with black text have not been assigned to an event. Tendons with gray text are assigned to a different event and can be moved into this event.
Tendons stressed during this activity | List of the tendons that are stressed during this activity.

> TIP: If the tendon stressing is modeled over several consecutive events, it is best to remove the temporary supports during the same event as the first tendons stressing activity. If the temporary supports are not removed at this time, the will provide a hold down reaction and prevent girder lift-off.
