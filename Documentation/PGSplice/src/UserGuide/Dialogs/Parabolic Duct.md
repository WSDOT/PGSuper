Parabolic Duct {#ug_dialogs_parabolic_duct}
==============================================
Define the geometry of the centerline of the duct with a sequence of parabolas defined by control points.

The parabolas connect to form a typical duct centerline for continuous girders. Low points of convex parabolas occur within spans and high points of concave parabolas occur over piers. The parameters are connect at inflection points.
