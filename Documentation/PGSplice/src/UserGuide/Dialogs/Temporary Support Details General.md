Erection tower temporary supports provide a vertical reaction load path to the ground. Strong back temporary supports connect adjacent segments.

> NOTE: Strong back temporary supports are essentially hinges. Be sure your model is geometrically stable.

Elevation adjustments can be applied to temporary supports where two segments are jointed together. The elevation adjustment modifies the vertical location of the segment ends from a straight line connecting the nearest permanent piers. See @ref tg_deflections for more information.
