Describe the general layout of a temporary support

Item | Description

Orientation | Enter the orientation of the temporary support line
Erection Event | Select the event when the temporary support is erected
Removal Event | Select the event when the temporary support is removed

Erection tower temporary supports provide a vertical reaction load path to the ground. Strong back temporary supports connect adjacent segments.

> NOTE: Erection towers provid a vertical load path to the ground for both tension and compression forces. When post-tensioning is applied, the girder may have the tendency to "lift off" the erection tower. A hold down (tension) reaction will be producted in the erection tower. Review the erection tower reactions and make sure they are removed at the appropriate stage in the construction timeline.

> NOTE: Strong back temporary supports are essentially hinges. Be sure your model is geometrically stable.

If segments are connected at this temporary support, then haunch depths and elevation adjustment define the elevation of the support at the time of erection of the first supported girder.

Item | Description
------|-----------------
Slab Offset Type | Use the drop down list to select a slab offset type
Slab Offset | Distance from top of cast slab to top of precast segment at centerline bearing
Elevation Adjustment | Vertical adjustment of temporary support elevation. Adjustment is applied just prior to erection of the first supported girder.
