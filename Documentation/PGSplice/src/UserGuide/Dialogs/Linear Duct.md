Linear Duct {#ug_dialogs_linear_duct}
==============================================
Define the geometry of the centerline of the duct with a sequence of duct points that are connected by linear segments.

The segments are defined by a sequence of duct points. The duct points are defined by their offset from the top or bottom of the girder and the horizontal position with respect to the left end of the girder or the distance from the previous point.
