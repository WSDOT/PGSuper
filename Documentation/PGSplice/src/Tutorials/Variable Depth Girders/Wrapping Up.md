==============================
This concludes the Variable Depth Girders PGSplice tutorial. This tutorial covered the basic steps for creating a PGSplice Project, editing the bridge model, and defining variable depth precast segments.

Now you are ready to model your own spliced girder bridges with PGSplice. The best way to learn all of PGSplice's options is to review the [User Guide](@ref user_guide).
