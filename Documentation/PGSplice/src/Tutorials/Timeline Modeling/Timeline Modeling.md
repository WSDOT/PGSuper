Timeline Modeling {#timeline_modeling}
============
PGSplice uses a non-linear time-step analysis method to compute prestress losses. The construction sequence is an important element of the time step analysis. Forces, stresses, and displacements change with time due to changes in material properties, structure topology, loading conditions, and time dependent effects due to creep and shrinkage of concrete, and relaxation of strands and tendons.

The timeline models the lifespan of a bridge with the sequence, timing, and duration of events that occur during the life of the bridge. At design time you typically will not know the exact construction schedule the bridge builder will use. Assumptions about the timing and sequence of construction activities will have to be made at design time.

This tutorial will highlight the timeline modeling features of PGSplice.
