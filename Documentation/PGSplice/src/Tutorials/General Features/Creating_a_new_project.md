Create a PGSplice Project {#tutorial_general_new_project}
==============================
New PGSplice projects are created from project templates. The templates contain standard configurations for bridge geometry and components, appurtenances, loading, and design criteria. Since this is a single span I-Girder bridge, the easiest place to start is with the 1 Span I-Girder template.

> TIP: You can create your own project templates and customize their organization. See @ref ug_configurations in the @ref user_guide for more information.


Start BridgeLink
--------------
To start the BridgeLink application framework, select *Start > Programs > Engineering Applications > BridgeLink*.

2. Select PGSplice Project Templates and then I-Beams from the Project types list.
3. Select 1 Span from the template list. Press [OK].
4. This will create a new project and bring up the Project Properties dialog where you can enter information about your project. ![](Tutorial_General_ProjectProperties.png)

> NOTE: The Project Properties dialog may not open when creating a new project. If this is the case, select *File > Project Properties* or *Project > Properties*. Use the check box at the bottom of the dialog to control whether the dialog opens when new projects are created.

Finally the default configuration for this type of bridge will be displayed in the Bridge Model View.
