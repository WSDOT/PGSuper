Plug-ins and Extentions {#ug_plugins}
==============================================
Plug-ins and extensions can extend the capabilities of this software. Plug-ins and extensions are typically developed by third parties and are optional components that are not necessarily required to use the software.

Many WSDOT and TxDOT-specific features are implemented with plug-ins and extensions. During the installation process you had the choice of installing optional WSDOT and TxDOT components. These components include specialized reporting and data exporting capabilities.

This software can also be extended by third parties including other Departments of Transportation, consulting engineering firms, universities, and other software developers. Plug-ins are easier to develop than extensions, but have limited capabilities. Extensions on the other hand are more complicated but have virtually unlimited capabilities. The XBRate, cross beam load rating, application is an example of a complex extension.

Plug-ins
--------
Three types of plug-ins are supported; Project Importers, Data Importers, and Data Exporters. 

### Project Importers ###
Project Importers integrate into the New Project window. Project importers create a new project by importing data from an external data source such as a database or data file from another similar application. 

### Data Importers ###
Data Importers differ from Project Importers in that they import data into an open project. Data Imports are found on the *File > Import* menu. 

### Data Exporters ###
Data Exporters are found on the *File > Export* menu. They can be used to export data to an external data source such as a database, file, or another application. The TxDOT and KDOT CAD Exporters are examples of this type of plug-in.

Extensions
----------
Extensions integrate into the application in many different ways and can offer the user many different capabilities. An extension can add commands to a menu, add new drop-down menus, add buttons to toolbars and add new toolbars, can add any type of view displaying any type of data, and can read and write extension-specific data. Extensions can also add new reports and graphs.
