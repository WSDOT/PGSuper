Saving Projects {#ug_projects_saving_projects}
==============================================
Save your projects using either the *File > Save* or *File > Save As* commands. Save allows you to quickly save your current project and keep working. Save As saves the current project with a new name.

> TIP: Computers are very unforgiving tools, especially when the power goes out. Save early and save often.
