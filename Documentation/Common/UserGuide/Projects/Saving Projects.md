Saving Projects {#ug_projects_saving_projects}
==============================================
Save your projects using either the *File > Save* or *File > Save As* commands. Save allows you to quickly save your current project and keep working. Save As saves the current project with a new name.

> TIP: Computers are very unforgiving tools, especially when the power goes out. Save early and save often.

Files are not backwards compatible. That is, files saved with the current version of the application cannot be read by older versions of the application. However, files saved with older versions can always be opened with newer versions of the application.

When saving a file that was created with an older version, you will be prompted with a warning and an opportunity to create a copy of the original file before it is updated to the current version.

> TIP: If the warning prompt doesn't appear the "Don't show me this warning" has been selected. To reset the warning, select *Options > Hints and Warnings...* and follow the instructions in the pop-up window.
