Copy Girder Properties {#ug_dialogs_copy_girder_properties}
==============================================
It is common practice for precast girder bridge designs to have all girders detailed identically. Copy Girder Properties provides a convenient method for copying the properties of one girder to other girders in the structure.

Copy Properties From
--------------------
Select the source girder whose properties you wish to copy

Copy Properties To
--------------------
Select the target girder(s) to which the properties will be copied. Target girders can be selected with either of two options. 

Option | Description
-------|------------
Single Girder, Span, Girderline or All | Using the drop down lists to select  the target girders
Multiple Girders |  Press [Select Girders] to select several target girders

Select Types of Properties to be Copied
----------------------------------------
Check the box next to the properties to be copied.

Property | Description
---------|---------------
Copy Concrete Material Properties | When checked, the properties of the girder concrete will be copied.
Copy Prestressing | When checked, both pretensioned and postensioned (if present) prestressing strand information (quantities, locations, jacking forces, debonding, etc.) will be copied. For bridges using several types of girders, prestressing information can only be copied between girders that are of the same type.
Copy Longitudinal Reinforcement | When checked, the longitudinal reinforcement will be copied. For bridges using several types of girders, longitudinal reinforcement can only be copied between girders that are of the same type.
Copy Transverse Reinforcement | When checked, the transverse shear reinforcement will be copied.
Copy Handling Locations | When check, the location of the lifting loops and the transportation support points will be copied.
Copy Slab Offset ("A" Dimension) | When check, the slab offset is copied.

Control Buttons | Description
