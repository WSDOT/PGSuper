Load Rating Summary Report Options {#ug_dialogs_loadrating_summary_report_options}
==============================================
Select a girder line or a selection of individual girders, and a list of chapters to be included in the report.

You can also select to report values at 1/10th points and controlling locations along spans, or at all analyzed locations. Note that reports with all locations are significantly longer than 1/10th point reports.

> Note that the controlling rating factors shown in the report are based on the selected girders only, and not for the entire bridge structure.
