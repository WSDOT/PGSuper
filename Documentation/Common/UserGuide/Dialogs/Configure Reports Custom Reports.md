Custom Reports {#ug_dialogs_custom_reports}
==============================================
Custom reports allow you to select and order a list of chapters from one report, and then save it as your own report. Once created, custom reports are used in the exact same manner as any other report. You can share your custom reports with other users and move them to another computer.
