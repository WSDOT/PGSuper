Additional Interface Shear Reinforcement {#ug_dialogs_girder_details_additional_interface_shear_reinforcement}
==============================================
Define additional horizontal interface shear reinforcement at the girder/slab interface.

Additional Horizontal Interface Shear Zones
---------------------------------------------
The bars in these zones are used to resist horizontal interface shear and are used in addition to any primary bars that have been extended into the deck. This zone layout is independent of the primary zones.

Item | Description 
-----|------------
Zone | The zone number
Zone Length | Length of the zone
Bar Size | Size of the  bar
Spacing | Spacing of the bars within the zone
\# of Legs | Number of bar legs extended into the deck.
[Insert Row] | Inserts a row into the grid
[Delete Row] | Removes a row from the grid


> NOTE: This input generally isn't used any more. In the LRFD 1st Edition 1994, 5.8.4, a minimum of four bars where required to cross the interface plane with the deck. It was common to add extra bars in the top flange of girders that had two bars extended into the deck, combined with two stirrup legs, to meet the four bar minimum. This requirement was removed in LRFD 2nd Edition 1998.
