Construction Loads {#ug_dialogs_construction_loads}
==============================================
Input a construction load allowance that will be carried by the non-composite girder section. This allowance covers additional loads incurred by the use of stay-in-place metal forms or other permanent construction materials and tolerances. This loading is applied to the entire bridge deck and is distributed to each girder based on its tributary area. This loading is applied to the DC load case.
