Load Modifiers {#ug_dialogs_load_modifiers}
==============================================
Enter load modifiers for Ductility, Redundancy, and Important on the tabs in this window. Refer to LRFD 1.3.2.1 for more information about load modifiers.

Ductility
----------
Select whether your structure is Non-Ductile, of Conventional Design, or has Enhanced Ductility. Enter the ductility factor <span style="font-family:Symbol">h</span><sub>D</sub> if you selected Non-Ductile or Enhanced Ductility. This value applies to the Strength Limit State only. All other limit states have <span style="font-family:Symbol">h</span><sub>D</sub>=1.0

Redundancy
-----------
Select whether your structure is Non-Redundant, of Conventional Level of Redundancy, or has Enhanced Redundancy. Enter the factor <span style="font-family:Symbol">h</span><sub>R</sub> if you selected Non-Redundant or Enhanced Redundancy. This value applies to the Strength Limit State only. All other limit states have <span style="font-family:Symbol">h</span><sub>R</sub>=1.0

Importance
------------
Select whether your structure is Important, of Typical Importance, or is Not Important (yeah right). Enter the factor <span style="font-family:Symbol">h</span><sub>I</sub> if you selected Important or Not Important. This value applies to the Strength Limit State only. All other limit states have <span style="font-family:Symbol">h</span><sub>I</sub>=1.0
