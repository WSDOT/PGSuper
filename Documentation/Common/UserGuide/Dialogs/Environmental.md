==============================================
Environmental conditions influence the evaluation of your bridge. Allowable tension limits depend on exposure conditions and relative humidity factors into creep and prestress loss calculations.

Exposure Conditions
---------------------
Defines the exposure condition at the bridge site. Bridges subject to severe corrosive conditions have a lower allowable tensile stress per LRFD 5.9.4.2.2

Average Ambient Relative Humidity
-------------------------------------
Relative Humidity factors into the calculation of creep and prestress losses (LRFD 5.4.2.3.1 and 5.9.5). Unless better information is available, the Average Ambient Relative Humidity can be taken from LRFD Figure 5.4.2.3.3-1
