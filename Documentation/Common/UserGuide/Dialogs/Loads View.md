Loads View {#ug_dialogs_loads_view}
==============================================
This view provides a convenient place to view, add, delete, or edit all user-defined loads in the model. All currently defined loads are shown in the list with a short description showing the magnitude of the load, its location, what construction event it is applied in, and which load case it is applied to. Loads can be edited by double clicking on the description.

There are several buttons along the bottom of the view for creating and managing user defined loads.
