Cast Longitudinal Joints {#ug_dialogs_cast_longitudinal_joints}
==============================================
Define timing properties for longitudinal joint casting

Item | Description
-----|---------------
Total curing duration | Enter the total curing duration. Concrete is assumed to be fully cured when it has sufficient strength to be consider composite with the girders
Active curing Duration | Enter the duration of active curing. Shrinkage strains are assumed to begin when curing ends.

> NOTE: The precast segments become a continuous girder when the total curing duration of the closure joint is complete. Closure joints must be cast and fully cured before PT tendons can be stressed.
