Layout {#ug_dialogs_bridge_description_layout}
==============================================
Use this tab to define the bridge framing plan.

Bridge starts at, and ends at...
------------
These controls allow definition of labeling for abutments, piers, and spans in the bridge model. This is useful when modelling a subsection of a large bridge (e.g., your model starts at Pier 5 (Span 5) and ends at abutment 12 (Span 11)). Note that these values only affect labels in the program user interface, reports, and graphs. Values entered do not affect engineering computations or results.

Select the support type (Pier or Abutment) for the start and end of your bridge model, and the starting numeric label for the support at the start of the bridge.

Layout Grid
------------
The grid defines the overall framing plan for your bridge model.

Item | Description

Grid | Define the bridge piers in this grid. Spans are located between the piers. More information about the grid is given below.
[Insert Span] | Insert a span
[Remove Span] | Remove the selected span. A pier can also be selected.
[Insert Temporary Support] | Insert a temporary support into the bridge model
[Remove Temporary Support] | Remove the selected temporary support
[Layout by Span Lengths...] | Define pier locations by defining span lengths
[Orient Piers] | Set all piers to the same orientation.

The following items are defined in the layout grid

Item | Description
-----|------------
Station | Station of the Abutment/Pier Line
Orientation | Orientation of the Abutment/Pier Line with the keyword NORMAL, a bearing, or a skew angle.
