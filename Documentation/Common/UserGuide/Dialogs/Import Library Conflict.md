Import Library Conflict {#ug_dialogs_import_library_conflict}
==============================================
When importing library entries from an existing file, you might get a message stating that an imported entry conflicts with an existing entry in your project file. This means that a library entry exists in the import file that has the same name, but not the same values, as an entry in your current project.

At this point, you have two options: You can elect to import the entry and give it a new name so you can use it later in your project, or you can elect not to import the entry at all.
