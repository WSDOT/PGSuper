Apply Loads {#ug_dialogs_apply_loads}
==============================================
Define loads that are applied during a construction event.

Select the loads applied during this event.
For common loads, check the box next to the loading condition to apply the load during this construction event. If the box is unchecked, the loading is not applied to the structure. 

For user defined loads, the loads in the right hand list are applied during this construction event.

> NOTE: If a box is filled with a square the load is applied to the structure in a different event. Check the box to move the load to this event.
