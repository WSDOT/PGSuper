Haunch Geometry {#ug_dialogs_haunch}
==============================================
The haunch geometry for the entire bridge can be defined in this window.

Fillet
------
Use the drop down list to select the method of defining the Fillet.

Enter the Fillet dimensions.

Slab Offset ("A" Dimension)
---------------------------
Use the drop down list to select the method of defining the slab offset.

Enter the slab offset dimensions.

> TIP: Refer to @ref tg_slab_offset and the Slab Haunch loading section of @ref tg_structural_analysis_models for more information about how the slab offset and fillet dimensions are used for slab offset design and haunch loading.

Assumed Excess Camber
---------------------
Enter the excess camber that is used to define the parabolic haunch depth used for computing composite section properties and/or haunch dead load. Note that this option is only available if the parabolic option is selected for computing composite section properties or haunch loading in the current Project Criteria library entry.

Refer to  the Slab Haunch loading section of @ref tg_structural_analysis_models for more information. Refer to @ref tg_section_properties in the Technical Guide for detailed information about haunch depth is used when computing composite section properties.

> TIP: Assumed Excess Camber input only used in PGSuper
