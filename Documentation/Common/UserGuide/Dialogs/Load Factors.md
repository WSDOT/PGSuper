Load Factors {#ug_dialogs_load_factors}
==============================================
Enter the limit state combination load factors.

These load factors allow you to adjust the limit state combinations listed in LRFD 3.4.1.

Load Combination | Description
---------|-------------
DC | dead load of structural components and nonnstructural attachments
DW | dead load of wearing surfaces and utilities
LL+IM | vehicular live load and vehicular dynamic load allowance. This load factor is also used for pedestrian live load
CR | force effects due to creep. The AASHTO LRFD does not provide a load factor for force effects related to strand relaxation. Strand relaxation is similar to creep so this load factor is used for force effects related to relaxation.
SH | force effects due to shrinkage
PS | secondary forces from post-tensioning for strength limit states; total prestress forces for service limit states

See @ref technical_guide - @ref tg_limit_states for more information.


> NOTE: Only the applicable load combination types are shown.

> NOTE: Pay careful attention to the live load factor for the Service III limit state. The 2016 interim revisions to the 7th Edition of the LRFD Specifications has made the live load factor dependent on the method of computing prestress losses. See LRFD Table 3.4.1-4.
