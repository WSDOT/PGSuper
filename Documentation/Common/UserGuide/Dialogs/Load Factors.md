Load Factors {#ug_dialogs_load_factors}
==============================================
Enter the limit state combination load factors.

These load factors allow you to redefine the limit state combinations listed in LRFD 3.4.1.

> NOTE: Pay careful attention to the live load factor for the Service III limit state. The 2016 interim revisions to the 7th Edition of the LRFD Specifications has made the live load factor dependent on the method of computing prestress losses. See LRFD Table 3.4.1-4.
