Copy Concrete {#ug_dialogs_copy_concrete}
==============================================
This window is used to copy the concrete properties from a Concrete Library Entry. 

Note that the properties are only copied and no reference is maintained back to the library entry (i.e., changes in the library entry will not carry through to where the data was copied).

Select Concrete Library Entry to Be Copied
--------------------------------------------
Choose the concrete from the drop down list.
