General {#ug_dialogs_pier_description_general}
==============================================
The general properties of piers and abutments are described on this tab. Piers and abutments are described by an arbitrary reference line called the Pier Line and the Abutment Line, respectively. This line is completely described by its location along the horizontal alignment and its orientation. The Abutment/Pier Line can be located at the Back of Pavement Seat, Centerline of Bearing, or any other line of your choosing. It is best to choose the reference line based on the information given on the layout sheet of your bridge plans.

Abutment/Pier Line
-------------------
Define the location and orientation of the Abutment/Pier Line

Item | Description
-----|-----------
Station | Enter the location of the reference line as a station along the horizontal alignment. If the station is changed from a previously defined value, use the drop down list to specify how the bridge is to be adjusted when this pier is moved from one station to another.
Orientation | Enter the orientation of the reference line. The orientation may be entered as the keyword "NORMAL", a bearing, or a skew angle.
Erection Event | Select the event when this pier/abutment is erected. (PGSplice only)

Slab Offset ("A" Dimension)
---------------------------
Define the slab offset at the pier.

Item | Description
-----|------------
Type | From the drop down list, select slab offset for the entire bridge or only for this pier.
Back | Slab offset on the back side of this pier
Ahead | Slab offset on the ahead side of this pier

If the slab offset is defined by pier and you click the drop down list to change the slab offset to be a single value for the entire bridge, the slab offset defined for this pier will be applied to the entire bridge. If the back and ahead slab offsets are different, you will be prompted to select one value.
