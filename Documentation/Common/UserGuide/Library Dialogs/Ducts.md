Outside Diameter (OD) | Enter the outside diameter of the duct
Inside Diameter (ID) | Enter the inside diameter of the duct
Nominal Diameter (ND) | Enter the nominal diameter of the duct
Strand Offset (Z) | Enter the strand offset. See LRFD C5.9.1.6

> Note: Starting with the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications, 9th Edition, 2020, the duct diameter for LRFD 5.4.6.2 and 5.7.3.3 is based on ["Shear Behavior of Spliced Post-Tensioned Girders"](https://library.ctr.utexas.edu/ctr-publications/0-6652-1.pdf), Moore. A. et al. These provious were developed based on the nominal diameter of the duct. The outside duct diameter is used for AASHTO LRFD specifications before the 9th Edition.
