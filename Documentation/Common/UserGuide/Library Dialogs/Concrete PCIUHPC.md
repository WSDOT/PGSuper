PCI UHPC {#ug_library_dialogs_concrete_pciuhpc}
==============================================
Define parameters for the PCI UHPC concrete model.

Parameter | Description
----------|------------
First peak (cracking) flexural strength, fcc | Stress level with first crack occurs. This value should be greater or equal to 1.5 ksi
Post-cracking design tensile strength, frr | Tensile strength that can be sustained by the concrete after first crack. This value should be at least 0.75 ksi
Fiber Length | Length of the steel fibers in the concrete matrix. Fibers should be a minimum of 1/2" in length.
Autogenous Shrinkage | Amount of autogenous (chemical) shrinkage in milli-strains (strain x 10^-3^).
Post-cure thermal treatment | Check this box if the concrete is subjected to post-cure thermal treatment.


Post-cure thermal treatment is defined as heating a UHPC element to a temperature of 194 F for a period of 48 hours starting after the concrete has reached and age of 24 hours and before it has reached 14 days.
