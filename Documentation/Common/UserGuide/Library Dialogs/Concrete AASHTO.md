AASHTO LRFD {#ug_library_dialogs_concrete_aashto}
==============================================
Define parameters for concrete based on the AASHTO model.

Parameter | Description
----------|------------
Averaging Factor, K1 | Correction factor for aggregate type in predicting average value. See @ref tg_concrete_properties in the @ref technical_guide for additional information.
Bounding Factor, K2 | Correction factor for aggregate type in predicting upper and lower bounds. See @ref tg_concrete_properties in the @ref technical_guide for additional information.
Creep | Creep of Concrete
Averaging Factor, K1 | Correction factor for aggregate type in predicting average value. See @ref tg_concrete_properties in the @ref technical_guide for additional information.
Bounding Factor, K2 | Correction factor for aggregate type in predicting upper and lower bounds. @ref tg_concrete_properties in the @ref technical_guide for additional information.
Shrinkage | Shrinkage of Concrete
Averaging Factor, K1 | Correction factor for aggregate type in predicting average value. See @ref tg_concrete_properties in the @ref technical_guide for additional information.
Bounding Factor, K2 | Correction factor for aggregate type in predicting upper and lower bounds. See @ref tg_concrete_properties in the @ref technical_guide for additional information.
Agg. Splitting Strength, fct | If the aggregate splitting strength of a lightweight concrete is known, check the box and input the value.
