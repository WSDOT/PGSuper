Moment Capacity {#ug_library_dialogs_project_criteria_moment_capacity}
==============================================
Define project criteria for computing moment capacity.


Moment Capacity
----------------

Item | Description
-----|-------------
Include girder longitudinal mild reinforcement in capacity calculations | When checked, the mild steel longitudinal reinforcement in the girder will be included in the capacity analysis. Prestressing strand is always included the capacity analysis.
Modulus of rupture for cracking moment (LRFD 5.4.2.6, 5.7.3.3.2) | Enter the coefficient for the modulus of rupture for computing cracking moment.

Resistance Factors (LRFD 5.5.4.2)
---------------------
Define the resistance factors

### Conventional Construction (LRFD 5.5.4.2.1) ###
Define the resistance factors for conventional construction for normal weight and lightweight concrete.

### Closure Joint (LRFD 5.5.4.2.2 and 5.14.1.3.2d) ###
Define the resistance factors for cast-in-place closure joints for normal weight and lightweight concrete.

Negative Moment Capacity
------------------------
Deck longitudinal reinforcement provides all tensile section forces in the negative moment region of the structure. This option specifies whether non-composite loads are included when computing the negative moment capacity.
