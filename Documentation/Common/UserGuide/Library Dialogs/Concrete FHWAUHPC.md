FHWA UHPC {#ug_library_dialogs_concrete_fhwauhpc}
==============================================
Define parameters for the FHWA UHPC concrete model.

Parameter | Description
----------|------------
Initial effective cracking strength (ft,cri) | The nominal effective cracking strength of UHPC at time of initial loading.
Design effective cracking strength (ft,cr) | The nominal effective cracking strength of UHPC specified for the work and assumed for design and analysis of new structures.
Crack localization strength (ft,loc) | Strength of concrete associated with crack localization.
Crack localization strain (et,loc) | Concrete strain when crack localization occurs.
Compressive stress-strain response factor (alpha.u) | Reduction factor to account for the nonlinearity of the UHPC compressive stress-strain response
Experimentally derived ultimate compressive strain (e.cu) | Ultimate compressive strain obtained experimentally.
Fiber Length | Length of the steel fibers in the concrete matrix.
