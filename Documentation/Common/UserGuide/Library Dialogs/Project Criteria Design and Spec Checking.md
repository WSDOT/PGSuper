Spec. Checking and Design {#ug_library_dialogs_project_criteria_design_and_spec_checking}
==============================================
Define project criteria for specification compliance checking and design.

Check the box for the "Check" option to enable specification compliance checking.

Check the box for the "Design" option to instruct the Girder Designer to consider a particular specification requirement during design.

At Release Check/Design Options
-------------------------------
Options for checking and design at time of prestress release.

Item | Description
-----|------------
Hold Down Force | Check and design the prestress hold down force generated by the deflection of harped strands. Enter the maximum permissible hold down force.
Harped Strand Slope Limits | Check and design for limiting slopes of harped strands. Enter the maximum permissible slope for strands that are 0.5" diameter and smaller, 0.6" diameter, and 0.7" diameter.
Splitting Resistance | Check and design for splitting resistance per LRFD 5.10.10.1. Enter the splitting zone length as a fraction of the girder height.
Confinement Reinforcement | Check and design the confinement reinforcement per LRFD 5.10.10.2.

Lifting Check/Design Options
------------------------------
Options for checking and design during lifting of the girder from the casting bed. Lifting analysis parameters are defined on the @ref ug_library_dialogs_project_criteria_lifting tab.

Item | Description
-----|------------
Min Lifting Point Location from ends of girder | Enter the minimum lifting point from the ends if the girder. Enter H if the minimum location is the girder height from the end.
Accuracy | Enter the lift point location accuracy used by the Girder Designer when establishing the lift point location.

Hauling Check/Design Options
------------------------------
Options for checking and design during hauling of the girder to the bridge site. Hauling analysis parameters are defined on the @ref ug_library_dialogs_project_criteria_hauling tab.

Item | Description
-----|------------
Min Truck Support Location from ends of girder | Enter the minimum support location from the ends if the girder. Enter H if the minimum location is the girder height from the end.
Accuracy | Enter the support location accuracy used by the Girder Designer when establishing the hauling support point locations.
Not to be less than | When checked, the truck support location is never taken to be less than this distance from the end of the girder. Enter a value less than 0.5. This parameter is used only for the Kansas hauling method.

Final Check/Design Options
--------------------------
Options for checking and design for the final bridge configuration

Item | Description
-----|--------------
Slab Offset ("A" Dimension) | Enable checking and design of the slab offset.
Live Load Deflection | Select whether to check LRFD 2.5.2.6.2 for deflection due to live loads. Enter the permissible deflection ratio (such as L/800). The LRFD optional deflection live load is specified in 3.5.1.3.1. Note that the live load is applied to the entire bridge structure using the stiffness of the slab, girders and barriers if structurally continuous. The barrier concrete material is assumed to be the same as the slab concrete. Slab fillet and slab offset ("A" dimension) effects are ignored (the deck is placed directly atop the girders). 
Bottom Flange Clearance | Check the box to enable bottom flange clearance checks. When enabled, the clear distance between bottom flanges will be computed and compared to the minimum bottom flange clearance specified in this setting. Owners may want to use this option to alert engineers to situations where the clearance between bottom flanges may cause construction or inspection access issues.
