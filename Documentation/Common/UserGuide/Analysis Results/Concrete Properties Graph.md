Concrete Properties Graph {#ug_concrete_properties_graph}
==============================================
The Concrete Properties graph provides various graphical representation of concrete properties as they vary with time.

The graph controller, found on the left side of the graph window, is used to select the properties to be graphed and other graphing parameters.

Graph Controller Item | Description
---------------------|----------------------
Element | Select the element for which the concrete properties are to be graphed
Property | Select the concrete property to be graphed. Creep coefficients are plotted for various times of loading.
Horizontal Axis | Select the horizontal axis type. Time plots the concrete properties with respect to the overall analysis timeline. Age plots concrete properties with respect to the age of the concrete. Interval plots concrete properties at discrete time intervals. For the Time and Age options, a linear or logarithmic scale can be used.
Show Grid | Toggles the grid.
