Girder Stability Graph {#ug_girder_stability_graph}
==============================================
The Girder Stability graph plots factors of safety against cracking, failure, and rollover, during lifting and hauling, for various support locations. This graph provides a quick method to determine lifting and hauling support locations for design. The graphs are based on the lifting and hauling criteria defined in the current Project Criteria and the current definition of the girder.

The graph controller is located at the top of the window.
