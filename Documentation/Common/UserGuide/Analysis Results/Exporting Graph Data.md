Exporting Graph Data {#ug_exporting_graph_data}
==============================================
Most graphs in the program support the ability to export data to an external file. This can be very useful for post-processing or exporting results to other programs.

Two file formats are supported:

***Export to Excel (.xlsx format)***
This method allows you to export data directly into the Excel program. Upon completion, the Excel program will open with a worksheet containing the graph data.

> Note that a desktop version of Microsoft Excel must be installed on you computer in order to use this option.

***Export to a Comma-Separated Value text file (.CSV format)***
This method allows you to export data to an ASCII text file where data values are delimited by the comma (,) character. Files in this format can be easily read by spreadsheet software, or your own custom program. CSV format does not require any special software to be installed on your computer, and in many cases will provide a more flexible way to programmatically deal with data.
