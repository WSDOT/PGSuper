Effective Prestress Graph {#ug_effective_prestress_graph}
==============================================
The Effective Prestress graph shows how the effective prestress or effective prestress force varies with both time and location for prestressing strands and post-tensioned tendons.

The graph controller, found on the left side of the graph window, is used to select the properties to be graphed and other graphing parameters.

Graph Controller Item | Description
---------------------|----------------------
Span, Girder | Select a span and girder
Prestressing Type | Select either pretensioning or post-tensioning graph
Permanent/Temporary | If Pretensioning is selected, select either Permanent or Temporary strands
Interval | Select the intervals for which to plot the effective prestress. Hold [CTRL] to select multiple, nonsequential, intervals. Hold [SHIFT] and select the first and last intervals in a range.
Stress/Force | Select if the effective prestress (fpe) or the effective prestress force (Fpe) is to be plotted
Show Grid | Toggles the grid
Show Girder | Toggles the girder
