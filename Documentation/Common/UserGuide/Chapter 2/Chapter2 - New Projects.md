New Projects {#chapter2_new_projects}
==============================================
New PGSuper Projects are created from Project Templates. Project templates contain standard configurations for bridge geometry and components, appurtenances, loading, and design criteria.

> NOTE: In PGSuper's world there is no "bridge wizard" and no such notion of a "blank file" (just like there is no such notion of a "blank bridge" in ours). All new PGSuper project files must be created from templates.

Create a New Project
--------------------
1. Select *File > New* to display the New Project dialog
2. Select a template that is representative of your bridge

Selecting a Template
--------------------
Select Project Templates from the New Project dialog, shown below. The Project Templates are organized on the various tabs. The organization of Project Templates may be customized, so the tabs on your New Project dialog might differ for that shown.

> See Chapter 3 of the Administrator Guide for details on managing and creating project templates

> TIP: The buttons on the right hand side of the dialog change the appearance of the project template icons. You can display the templates as large icons, small icons, or in a detailed list.
