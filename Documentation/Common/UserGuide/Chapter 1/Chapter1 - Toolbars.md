Toolbars {#chapter1_toolbars}
==============================================
PGSuper has three toolbars to provide quick access to frequently used commands. The toolbars are typically located at the top of the main window, however, they can be positioned on any side of the main window by simply dragging and dropping them. Toolbars can even "float" anywhere on your computer screen
