Context Menus {#chapter1_context_menus}
==============================================
Many of the items in PGSuper's windows are context-sensitive. This means that you can double-click on them to execute commands (such as editing girders, alignments, loads, etc.), or right-click on them to bring up context menus. Context menus provide quick access to commonly used commands within the context of a certain task. They group commands together that you would otherwise have to choose from several different menus.

Activate a context menu by pressing the right mouse button. You can then move the pointer over the list of commands and use the right or left mouse button to select the desired option.

Context Menus are available on the Bridge Model View, Girder Views, Report Views, and Library View.

> TIP: The mouse symbol, <span style="font-family:Wingdings;">8</span>, indicates a context menu is available for the procedure that is being described.
