Chapter 1 - Introduction {#chapter1}
==============================================
PGSuper (<b>P</b>restressed <b>G</b>irder <b>SUPER</b>structures) is Precast-Prestressed Girder design, analysis, and load rating software for the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specification. PGSuper is jointly developed by the Washington State and Texas Departments of Transportation.

PGSuper designs and checks precast-prestressed girder bridges in accordance with the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specification. Load ratings are in accordance with the AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation. PGSuper is easily configured to evaluate a variety of localized criteria such as those defined in the WSDOT and TxDOT Bridge Design Manuals. The flexural design feature computes the number and configuration of prestressing strands, determines the minimum concrete release strength and the minimum 28 day concrete strength. Flexural design also considers the effects of girder lifting and transportation to determine concrete strengths and to insure girder stability during handling. The shear design feature determines the number, size, and spacing of transverse reinforcement for vertical shear, horizontal shear, splitting, and strand confinement. Specification checking evaluates girders for compliance with strength, service, and detailing criteria. Girders are evaluated for stresses and stability during handling and transportation. Temporary prestressing to improve stability during handling and shipping, control camber, and reduce concrete release strengths are also considered. The capabilities and constraints of local fabricators can been accounted for in this software product. 

PGSuper supports the following families of girder sections:
* I-Beams
* U-Beams
* Deck Bulb Tees
* Box Beams
* Slabs (voided and solid)
* Multi-stem Beams (ribbed girders)

PGSuper provides a *Bridge-centric* approach to bridge engineering software. Traditional bridge engineering software requires the engineer to focus his/her attention on cryptic data files, verbose problem oriented languages, or data driven graphical user interfaces. The *Bridge-centric* approach employs principles of visualization and direct manipulation resulting in software that enables the engineer to concentrate on the bridge at hand.

PGSuper supports plug-ins and extensions. Plug-ins are simple software components that provide data import and export capabilities. Extensions are more complex. Extensions can integrated into the PGSuper user interface and provide new and enhanced capabilities.

About this Manual
=================

Organization
------------
The chapters in the User Guide are organized in the following way:

* The Introduction chapter gives an overview of PGSuper and the manual. In addition, all the menus and toolbar commands are described in one convenient location.
* The chapters in the middle sections are arranged in the order of tasks typically performed by an engineer. These tasks include, creating a new project, editing the structure, performing a design, and reviewing analysis results.
* The last chapters provided information for customizing PGSuper.
* The appendices provide detailed information for all PGSuper inputs.

Conventions
-----------
The PGSuper documentation uses a few special symbols and conventions.

* Specific text you are to type in and the names of commands to choose are shown in bold.
* Keys are frequently used in combinations or sequences. For example, SHIFT+F1 (with a + sign) means to hold down the SHIFT key while pressing F1, and ALT,F,A (with comma) means to press and release each of these in order: first ALT, then F, and then A.
* Menu selections are separated by a "greater than" symbol. *File > Open* means, select the Open command from the File menu.
* To choose a command from a menu, you can use the mouse or press a key combination. In procedures, key sequences follow the menu and command names. For example: Select *File > Open* (ALT,F,O).
* For commands with a toolbar button alternative, the button appears next to the command.
* For operations with a context (right click) menu alternative, a mouse symbol <span style="font-family:Wingdings;">8</span> appears next to the command.
* Notes and Tips have a shaded background

> TIP: This is a tip.

> NOTE: This is a note.
