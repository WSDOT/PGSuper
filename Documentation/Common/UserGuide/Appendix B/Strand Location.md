Strand Location {#appendix_b_strand_location}
==============================================
Use this dialog to defined the location of a strand position

Item | Description
----|-----
Strand Type | Select the type of strand 
Allow straight strand(s) to be debonded | Check this box if these straight strands can be debonded.
Xb,Yb | Strand position measured from the bottom center of the girder
Xt,Yt | Strand position measured from the top center of the girder

> NOTE: X values must be positive or zero. If X is greater that zero two strand positions are created: one at (X,Y) and another at (-X,Y). This enforces the requirement that all prestressing must be symmetric about the Y axis. If X is zero, the strand position is located on the Y axis.
