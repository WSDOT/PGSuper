Harping Points {#appendix_b_girder_harping_points}
==============================================
The location of harping points are defined on this tab.

Using the drop down lists, select the location from where the harping point is measured and how it is measured. The harping point can be measured from the end of the girder, the bearing, or the centerline of the girder. The location can be measured as a fixed distance, a fraction of the girder length, or a fraction of the span length. For fractional measure, the value must be greater than zero and less than or equal to 0.5. When a fixed distance is used, and the harping point is past the center of the girder, both harping points are put at the center of the girder.

An optional minimum distance from the reference point may be specified.

Unless the harping point is placed at mid-span, PGSuper will create two harping points on either side of the centerline of the beam. For example, if the harping point is specified to be at 0.4L from the end of the girder, harping points will be placed at 0.4L and 0.6L.
