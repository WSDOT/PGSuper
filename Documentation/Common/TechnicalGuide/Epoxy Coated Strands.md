Epoxy Coated Strands {#tg_epoxy_coated_strands}
======================================
Grit impregnated epoxy coated strands may be modeled. The recommendatons presented in ["Guidelines for the use of Epoxy-Coated Strand", PCI Journal, July-August 1993](https://www.pci.org/PCI_Docs/Publications/PCI%20Journal/1993/July/Guidelines%20for%20the%20Use%20of%20Epoxy-Coated%20Strand.pdf) are used for transfer length and relaxation losses.

Transfer Length
---------------
The recommended transfer length is 50d<sub>b</sub>.

Relaxation
----------
Relaxation of epoxy coated strands is taken to be double that of uncoated strands.
