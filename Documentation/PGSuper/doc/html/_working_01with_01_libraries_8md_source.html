The Girder entries are included into your project by reference; however there are some parameters that you will want to override for your project. The Girder library is said to be Referenced with Seed Data. The definition of a girder includes standardized information for transverse (shear) and longitudinal reinforcement. By including this in the library, you can easily model standard reinforcement arrangements in your project. However, if the standard arrangement doesn&#39;t work for your particular bridge, you&#39;ll have to enter a different arrangement. If the Girder library did not allow for seed data, you would have to copy the girder, change the reinforcement details, and reference the new girder entry. This is tedious. For this reason, the Girder library has seed data for the reinforcement details. Your project references a girder and then you can override the reinforcement as needed. You can restore your input to the library defaults at any time by pressing [Restore to Library Defaults] in the Girder Details window.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00033"></a><span class="lineno">   33</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00034"></a><span class="lineno">   34</span>&#160;![](ReferencedWithSeedDataLibraryEntry.png)</div><div class="line"><a name="l00035"></a><span class="lineno">   35</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00036"></a><span class="lineno">   36</span>&#160;Library Scope</div><div class="line"><a name="l00037"></a><span class="lineno">   37</span>&#160;---------------</div><div class="line"><a name="l00038"></a><span class="lineno">   38</span>&#160;Libraries greatly simply your project.

You send this file to your colleague and he opens it.

You are using the same configuration as when the project was originally created, however when you open the project a library entry conflict occurs. This typically happens when the configuration is updated. For example, there is a policy change and the owner agency now requires that the Service III tension stress be limited to 0.0 KSI instead of the limit permitted by AASHTO. The configuration publisher updated their Project Criteria to reflect this policy change. Your project file was created before this policy change and your copy of the Project Criteria no longer matches the current standard.
