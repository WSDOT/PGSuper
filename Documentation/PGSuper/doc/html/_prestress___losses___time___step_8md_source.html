The deformations, stresses, and internal forces that develop in response to external loads and time-dependent material effects are computed for each time interval. The time-dependent material effects include changes in concrete strength and elastic modulus as a function of time, creep and shrinkage of concrete, and relaxation of prestressing strands. The response of the structure at the end of any time interval is taken to be the summation of the responses of the preceding intervals. </div><div class="line"><a name="l00016"></a><span class="lineno">   16</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00017"></a><span class="lineno">   17</span>&#160;Conceptually, time-step analysis is a straightforward method based on fundamental principles of engineering mechanics. The method of time-step analysis discussed below was originally presented by Tadros, et.al.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; in 1977. A summary will be presented that focuses on the key elements of the analysis method. The challenge of time-step analysis is the enormous quantity of calculations that must be performed. Several factors contribute to the computational burden of this method. Concrete strength, and thus the modulus of elasticity, increases as a function of time resulting in different transformed section properties in each time interval.  Spliced girders are often non-prismatic with deeper sections at intermediate piers than in the main spans. Tendon profiles typically have varying eccentricities which further compounds the computation of section properties. Creep strain rates change as a function of time and incremental loading. Shrinkage strain and strand relaxation rates also vary with time. The sheer quantity of calculations that must be performed for a rigorous time-step analysis make computer aided design the only feasible option.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00018"></a><span class="lineno">   18</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00019"></a><span class="lineno">   19</span>&#160;Time Varation of Material Properties</div><div class="line"><a name="l00020"></a><span class="lineno">   20</span>&#160;-------------------------------------</div><div class="line"><a name="l00021"></a><span class="lineno">   21</span>&#160;Precast concrete spliced girders are a composition of precast concrete segments, cast-in-place closure joints, a cast-in-place concrete deck, strands, tendons, and reinforcing bars. The parts of a spliced girder can be classified into three distinct materials; concrete, prestressing steel, and nonprestressed reinforcing bars. Concrete has a time-dependent stress strain relationship because of creep and shrinkage. Prestressing steel has a time-dependent stress strain relationship due to relaxation. Nonprestressed reinforcement is assumed to be a linear elastic material obeying Hooke&#39;s law.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00022"></a><span class="lineno">   22</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00023"></a><span class="lineno">   23</span>&#160;Any suitable time variation relationship for elastic modulus, creep, shrinkage and relaxation can be used in the time-step analysis. AASHTO LRFD provides general relationships for elastic modulus, creep and shrinkage that can be used in lieu of project-specific material data. However, AASHTO LRFD does not provide time variation relationships for the strength of concrete or intrinsic relaxation of prestressing steel. AASHTO LRFD permits the use of the time variation relationships from American Concrete Institute Committee 209 (ACI 209) and the CEB-FIP Model Code (CEB-FIP).</div><div class="line"><a name="l00024"></a><span class="lineno">   24</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00025"></a><span class="lineno">   25</span>&#160;Timeline Modeling</div><div class="line"><a name="l00026"></a><span class="lineno">   26</span>&#160;------------------</div><div class="line"><a name="l00027"></a><span class="lineno">   27</span>&#160;A mathematical model of time is central to the time-step analysis method. A sequence of discrete time intervals is used to model the design timeline. The duration of each interval is determined by the time at which changes in loading and the statical structural system are assumed to occur. Suddenly applied loads (e.g. prestress force, self-weight, and superimposed loads) and sudden changes to the statical structural system (e.g. removal of temporary supports) are assumed to cause an instantaneous response in the structure at a specific time. Because the time-dependent material responses are most appreciable immediately following a sudden change in internal resisting forces the timeline is further divided into small time intervals following the load application. The length of intervals can be increased progressively as time goes on. Time dependent changes are continuous during an interval. The total change in loading during an interval is assumed to occur at the middle of the interval and that the duration of intervals when sudden changes occur is zero. The design timeline generally begins when the first pretension strand is stressed and concludes at the end of the design life of the structure.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00028"></a><span class="lineno">   28</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00029"></a><span class="lineno">   29</span>&#160;Incremental Deformations</div><div class="line"><a name="l00030"></a><span class="lineno">   30</span>&#160;------------------------</div><div class="line"><a name="l00031"></a><span class="lineno">   31</span>&#160;The time-step method analyzes deformations, stresses, and forces in each part of a spliced girder as a summation of the incremental responses in the preceding intervals.

The incremental forces on the concrete parts due to initial deformations are accounted for in the first term of Equations (1) and (2) during the interval when the forces first develop and in the summation in subsequent intervals.  </div><div class="line"><a name="l00117"></a><span class="lineno">  117</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00118"></a><span class="lineno">  118</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00119"></a><span class="lineno">  119</span>&#160;References</div><div class="line"><a name="l00120"></a><span class="lineno">  120</span>&#160;-------------</div><div class="line"><a name="l00121"></a><span class="lineno">  121</span>&#160;1.
