Girders {#ug_dialogs_span_description_girders}
==============================================
Define the girder type and spacing.

Click on the combo box to select between defining parameters for the entire bridge or for just this span.

Item | Description
-----|--------------
Number of Girders | Enter the number of girders
Girder Type Grid | Select the type of girder for each girder line
Girder/Joint Spacing | Use the drop down list to select how and where the girder spacing or joint width is measured
Girder/Joint Spacing Grid | Enter the spacing between girder lines or joint width
Locate | Use these parameters to transversely locate the girders
[Copy to End/Start of Span] | Press to copy the girder spacing information to the opposite end of the span

Using the Grids
----------------
Use the grouping features to create groups of girders or spacing. 

The grid can be expanded to provide a column for each by selecting the column heading, right clicking, and choosing the Expand command

Transversely Locating Girders
------------------------------
The girders must be located transversely with respect to the alignment. The location of the girder is measured in the same direction, and along the same line, as the girder spacing.

Item | Description
-----|-------------
Locate Drop Down List | Select a specific girder, or "Center of Girders", to locate transversely. "Center of Girders" is the mid-point between the centerline of the left and right exterior girders
Location | Enter the location of the selected girder
From Drop Down List | Select the location from which the selected girder is measured.

Top Width
---------
The layout for certain girder types is defined by joint widths and girder top widths rather than the centerline spacing. Use the top width grid to define the top width girders within the span. 

Select a top width type and enter the top width dimensions. Top width types are Symmetric (the top flange is symmetric about the centerline of the girder), Centered CG (the length of the top flange on the left and right side of the girder centerline are automatically computed such that the center of gravity of the girder is coincident with the girder centerline), and Asymmetric (the top flange is asymmetric and defined by unique left and right overhangs measured from the girder centerline).
