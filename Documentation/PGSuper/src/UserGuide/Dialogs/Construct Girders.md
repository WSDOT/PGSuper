Construct Girders {#ug_dialogs_construct_segments}
==============================================
Select girders that are constructed during this event and define timing properties.

Item | Description
-----|--------------
Girders to be constructed | List all of the girders. Girders with black text have not been assigned to an event. Girders with gray text are assigned to a different event and can be moved into this event.
Girders constructed during this activity | List of the girders constructed during this activity.
[>] and [<] | Move girders between the two lists
Time from strand stressing to release | The elapsed time between stressing the prestressing strands and imparting the force onto the precast girder. This time is used to compute initial relaxation losses.
Total curing duration | Age when the concrete is considered to have sufficient strength to take the pretensioning force (concrete age at release). This is the age of the concrete when it reaches a strength of f'ci.
