Bridge Modeling {#ug_bridge_modeling}
==============================================
In this section you will learn about editing your bridge model and the Bridge View.

You can think of your bridge model at two different levels. At the top level, there is the overall configuration of the bridge, including the roadway alignment information, pier locations, girder framing, and the cross section. At the lower level, there are the details of each girder in the structure. This section will focus on modeling the bridge; @ref ug_girder_modeling will focus on modeling individual girders.

All of the bridge editing is done in the Bridge Description Window. Open the Bridge Description Window by choosing *Edit > Bridge*.

We'll look at the following topics:
