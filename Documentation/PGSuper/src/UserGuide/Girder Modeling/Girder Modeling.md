Girder Modeling {#ug_girder_modeling}
==============================================
In this section you will learn about the Girder View and how to edit the girders in your bridge.

Each girder in the bridge can have a different section type and can have different configurations (such as span length, concrete properties, strand configuration, and handling points). Geometric effects like piers with opposing skews or horizontal curvature cause the girders within a span to be different length. Girders of differing lengths potentially require different prestressing, shear reinforcement, concrete properties, etc. For those cases when all of the girders in your structure are the same, you can define one girder and use the @ref ug_dialogs_copy_girder_properties tool to copy the properties of one girder to another, simplifying the editing task.

The Girder View provides a visual representation of the girders in your bridge as well as context-sensitive editing capabilities.

We'll look at the following topics:
