Introduction {#ug_introduction}
==============================================
PGSuper (<b>P</b>restressed <b>G</b>irder <b>SUPER</b>structures) is Precast-Prestressed Girder design, analysis, and load rating software for the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specification. PGSuper is jointly developed by the Washington State and Texas Departments of Transportation.

PGSuper designs and checks precast-prestressed girder bridges in accordance with the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specification. Load ratings are in accordance with the AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation. PGSuper is easily configured to evaluate a variety of localized criteria such as those defined in State DOT Bridge Design Manuals. The flexural design feature computes the number and configuration of prestressing strands, determines the minimum concrete release strength and the minimum 28 day concrete strength. Flexural design also considers the effects of girder lifting and transportation to determine concrete strengths and to insure girder stability during handling. The shear design feature determines the number, size, and spacing of transverse reinforcement for vertical shear, horizontal shear, splitting, and strand confinement. Specification checking evaluates girders for compliance with strength, service, and detailing criteria. Girders are evaluated for stresses and stability during handling and transportation. Temporary prestressing to improve stability during handling and shipping, control camber, and reduce concrete release strengths can also be considered. The capabilities and constraints of local fabricators can been accounted for in this software product. 

PGSuper supports the following general families of girder sections:
* I-Beams
* U-Beams
* Deck Bulb Tees
* Box Beams
* Slabs (voided and solid)
* Multi-stem Beams (ribbed girders)

PGSuper provides a *Bridge-centric* approach to bridge engineering software. Traditional bridge engineering software requires the engineer to focus his/her attention on cryptic data files, verbose problem oriented languages, or data driven graphical user interfaces. The *Bridge-centric* approach employs principles of visualization and direct manipulation resulting in software that enables the engineer to concentrate on the bridge at hand.

PGSuper can be customized to meet your needs through the use of Configurations, Plug-ins, and Extensions. Configurations define girder types, project criteria, and other information that supports an owner-agency's practices and policies. Configurations for several State DOT's are available. By changing configurations you can change how PGSuper works. Plug-ins and Extensions are typically developed by third parties. Plug-ins and extensions can add new functionality to the software.
