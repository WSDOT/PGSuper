Girder {#ug_library_dialogs_girder}
==============================================
The Girder window is used to define the properties of precast girders. Girders are defined by not only their cross sectional dimensions, but also by the possible location of permanent and temporary prestressing strands, default transverse and longitudinal reinforcement, and design and analysis results specific to a particular type of girder.

A girder is defined on the following tabs:

* @subpage ug_library_dialogs_girder_general
* @subpage ug_library_dialogs_girder_permanent_strands
* @subpage ug_library_dialogs_girder_temporary_strands
* @subpage ug_library_dialogs_girder_flexural_design
* @subpage ug_library_dialogs_girder_shear_design
* @subpage ug_library_dialogs_girder_harping_points
* @subpage ug_library_dialogs_girder_longitudinal_reinforcement
* @subpage ug_library_dialogs_girder_transverse_reinforcement
* @subpage ug_library_dialogs_girder_haunch_and_camber
* @subpage ug_library_dialogs_girder_diaphragms
