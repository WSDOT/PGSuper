Create a New Project {#tutorial_sidewalks_create_a_new_project}
============
New PGSuper projects are created from project templates. The templates contain standard configurations for bridge geometry and components, appurtenances, loading, and design criteria. Since this is a WSDOT WF74G girder bridge, the easiest way to start is with the WF74G template.

> TIP: You can customize project templates and their organization. See @ref ug_configurations in the @ref user_guide for more information.

Start PGSuper

To start PGSuper, select *Start > Programs > Engineering Applications > PGSuper*.

> NOTE: The Project Properties window may not open when creating a new project. If this is the case, select *File > Project Properties* or *Project > Properties*. Use the check box at the bottom of the window to control whether the window opens when new projects are created.

Finally the default configuration for this type of bridge will be displayed in the Bridge Model View.
