Bridges with Sidewalks {#sidewalks}
============
This example will demonstrate techniques for modeling sidewalks, combination railings, and pedestrian live loads on a highway bridge structure.

The bridge for this example is 180 feet in length and has 11 WF74G girders spaced at 6 ft on center. The deck slab overhangs are 2'-6". The bridge is 65' wide between edges of deck.

The exterior barriers are 42" Single Slope barriers. An 18" x 42" combination railing is used on the left side of the bridge. The sidewalks are 10ft wide and 6" deep.
