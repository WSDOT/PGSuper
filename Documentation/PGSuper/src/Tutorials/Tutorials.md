============
The purpose of the tutorials is to get you up and running with PGSuper as quickly as possible. Each tutorial highlights different aspects of the software.

> NOTE: PGSuper comes configured for WSDOT. The tutorials will be based on WSDOT girder sections. However, PGSuper is not limited to WSDOT girder sections. Any girder section conforming to the general type of Box Beam, Deck Bulb Tee, Double-Tee, Nebraska NU, I-Beams, U-Beams, and Voided Slabs can be modeled.

@subpage general_features <br>
This tutorial highlights the major features of PGSuper. At times, we deviate from what might be considered "normal practice" to illustrate certain features. Please consider this tutorial a lesson on using PGSuper and not a lesson in precast girder design.

@subpage pedestrian <br>
This tutorial describes the techniques required to design a pedestrian only bridge in accordance with the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications. The prominent feature of this tutorial is the use of user defined live loads.

@subpage sidewalks <br>
This tutorial describes the techniques required to model sidewalks and pedestrian live load in accordance with the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications. The prominent features of this tutorial are modeling sidewalks and combination railings.

@subpage advanced_geometry <br>
This tutorial describes the advanced geometric modeling capabilities of PGSuper including modeling a bridge with different number of girders in each span, flared girder spacing, and tapered bridge decks..

While these tutorials provide you with a great deal of information, they barely scratch the surface of PGSuper. Additional information can be found in the @ref user_guide and the @ref technical_guide.
