KDOT XML Export {#mainpage}
============

The KDOT XML Export feature was funded by the Kansas Department of Transportation to provide a way to export PGSuper bridge data and results in a portable an flexible file format. 

The schema and documentation for the file format can be found in the file **KDOTExporter.xsd** which is located in the PGSuper installation folder.

> Note that you must have the KDOT exporter extension installed and registered in COM in order to use this feature. The normal way to do this is to select the KDOT extensions option during the normal installation of PGSuper.
 
> TIP: You can create your own custom PGSuper reports using KDOT Export files and XSL transforms.
