<p>Custom reports allow you to select and reorder a list of chapters from 
 one of PGSuper's built-in reports, and then save it as your own report. 
 Once created, custom reports are used in the exact same manner as built-in 
 PGSuper reports. You can also share your custom reports with other users 
 or move them to another computer.</p>

<p>To use custom reports, first create your custom reports by going to 
 &quot;Options | Reporting&quot; from the main PGSuper menu. Then select 
 the Custom Reports tab. </p>

<p>The list box shows a list of all custom reports on your system. From 
 there, you can add new reports, edit existing reports, and delete reports 
 from your system. </p>

<p class=Tip>Tip: Custom reports can be put into your Favorite Reports 
 list. This way you have quick access to frequently used custom reports.</p>

<h2>Editing a Custom Report</h2>

<p>To edit a custom report, double-click on the report in the list, or 
 select the report and click the Edit button. Here, you have several options 
 for defining your custom report.</p>

<h4>Report Name</h4>

<p>Enter a name for your custom report. Note that this name cannot be the 
 same as other reports on the system including built-in reports and other 
 custom reports.</p>

<h4>Use Chapters from Parent</h4>

<p>Select the parent for this custom report. A custom report may contain 
 chapters only from its parent. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->A 
 custom report may only have one parent report.</p>

<h4>Selecting Chapters</h4>

<p>Upon selecting a parent, you will be presented with a list of available 
 chapters that can be placed in your custom report. Use the &quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot; 
 and &quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot; buttons to add and remove chapters 
 from your custom report. Once selected, a chapter may be moved up or down 
 to establish its location in the report.</p>

<h4>Include this Report in Favorites</h4>

<p>Check this option if you want the current custom report to be include 
 in the favorites list. More information about favorite reports may be 
 found <a href="FavoriteReports.htm">here</a></p>

<h2>Importing and Exporting Custom Reports</h2>

<p>Custom report information may be saved to a file (exported) so that 
 it may be shared with other PGSuper users. To export your custom reports, 
 click export, select the reports that are to be exported, and then select 
 the file where the report information is to be stored. </p>

<p>Once exported, you can import the report information by selecting the 
 Import button and then the file to be imported. Note that imported reports 
 may not have the same name as existing reports. If this condition exists, 
 you will be prompted to rename or skip importing of the report.</p>
