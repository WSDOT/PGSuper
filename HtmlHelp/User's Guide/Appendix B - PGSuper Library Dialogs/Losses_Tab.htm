<h1>Losses Tab</h1>

<p>Use this tab to select the method for calculating prestress losses.</p>

<h2>Select method for computing losses</h2>

<p>Using the drop down list, select the method that will be used for computing 
 losses.</p>

<p>The LRFD specification does not explicitly provide a method of estimating 
 losses at the time of shipping. For refined estimates (LRFD 5.9.5.4), 
 for LRFD 2005 and later, input the day after release when shipping will 
 take place. If there is a range of days when shipping can occur, input 
 the earliest time for a conservative estimate. </p>

<p>For approximate methods (LRFD 5.9.5.3) the shipping losses can be described 
 as a lump sum value or a percentage of the final losses. Use the drop 
 down list to select the method for shipping losses and enter an appropriate 
 value. </p>

<p>For refined estimates (LRFD 5.9.5.4), for LRFD 2005 and later, select 
 the method for computing relaxation losses.</p>

<p>For General Lump Sum Losses, enter appropriate values for losses immediately 
 before and after prestress transfer, at shipping, and for the final service 
 condition.<span style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp; </span></p>

<h2>Elastic Gains</h2>

<p>PGSuper uses gross section properties for its stress analysis. To compensate 
 for not using transformed properties, elastic gains may be computed and 
 added to the effective prestress force. For refined estimates (LRFD 5.9.5.4), 
 for LRFD 2005 and later, define the percentage of the various external 
 loads that will contribute to the elastic gains.</p>

<p>Gains due to slab shrinkage must also include increased stresses at 
 the top and bottom of the girder. Slab shrinkage is computed as defined 
 in LRFD 5.9.5.4.3d. The shrinkage strain is scaled by the percentage defined 
 on this tab. The stresses in the girders is computed using equation 5.9.5.4.3d-2 
 with St and Sb being substituted for epc/Ic.</p>

<h2>Post-Tensioning Parameters</h2>

<p>Enter the anchor set, wobble friction coefficient, and coefficient of 
 friction for compute losses in post-tensioned temporary strands.</p>

<h2>Transfer Length of Pretensioned Prestressing Strands</h2>

<p><span style="margin-bottom: 0;">T</span>ransfer length is defined as 
 &quot;the length over which the pretensioning force is transferred to 
 the concrete by bond and friction in <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->a 
 pretensioned member&quot;. LRFD 5.11.4.1 defines the transfer length as 
 60 strand diameters. PGSuper accounts for reduced prestress forces in 
 the transfer zone using linear interpolation as described in the Specifications.</p>

<p>However, some agencies may wish to ignore the effect of prestress transfer 
 (zero transfer length) and assume that the strand is fully effective right 
 to the debond location. Note that this option may, or may not, be conservative 
 depending on the limit state or behavior under consideration. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->If 
 selected, the &quot;Zero Transfer&quot; option will approximate this condition 
 by setting the transfer length to 0.1 inches. A true &quot;zero transfer 
 length&quot; cannot be used as it will create &quot;jumps&quot; in the 
 stress due to prestressing. That is, on unbonded side of a debond section 
 the stress due to prestressing will be zero and on the other side it will 
 &quot;jump&quot; to some value - mathematically this is a discontinuous 
 function and wreaks havoc with the design and analysis algorithms..</p>

<p class=Tip>Note that the zero transfer option will affect all pretensioned 
 designs, including debonded and harped designs.</p>
