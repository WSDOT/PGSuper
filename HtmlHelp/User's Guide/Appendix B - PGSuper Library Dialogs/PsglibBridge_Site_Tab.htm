<h1>Bridge Site 3 Tab</h1>

<p>Use this tab to define criteria pertinent at bridge site stage 3. This 
 is when the bridge is in service and open to traffic.</p>

<h2>Allowable Concrete Compressive Stresses</h2>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Service I (Permanent Plus Live Loads)</span></h3>

<p>Enter the multiplier for the maximum allowable concrete compressive 
 stress for the Service I limit state. Guidance for this value is given 
 in LRFD 5.9.4.2.1.</p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Service IA/Fatigue I (Live Load Plus 
 One-Half of Permanent Loads)</span></h3>

<p>Enter the multiplier for the maximum allowable concrete compressive 
 stress for a load combination comprised of live load plus one-half of 
 all permanent loading. Guidance for this value is given in LRFD 5.9.4.2.1 
 until the 2009 interim provisions to the 4th Edition. Beginning with the 
 2009 interim provisions to the 4th Edition, the Fatigue I limit state 
 was introduced. The allowable stress for the Fatigue I limit state is 
 given in LRFD 5.5.3.1.</p>

<h2>Allowable Concrete Tensile Stresses - Service III Limit State</h2>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Normal Exposure Conditions</span></h3>

<p>Enter the multiplier for the maximum allowable concrete tensile stress 
 for normal environmental exposure conditions. You may also enter an absolute 
 maximum value if desired. Guidance for these values is given in LRFD 5.9.4.2.2.</p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Severe Corrosive Conditions</span></h3>

<p>Enter the multiplier for the maximum allowable concrete tensile stress 
 for severely corrosive environmental exposure conditions. You may also 
 enter an absolute maximum value if desired. Guidance for these values 
 is given in LRFD 5.9.4.2.2.</p>

<h2>Live Load Distribution Factors</h2>

<p>This option allows you to select the default method to compute distribution 
 factors, and some other parameters related to distribution factors</p>

<h3><span>Method</span></h3>

<p>Select whether to calculate distribution factors in accordance with 
 the AASHTO LRFD Specifications, the <a HREF="..\..\Theoretical Manual\Live_Load_Distribution_Factors.htm">WSDOT 
 Bridge Design Manual.</a>, or The <a href="../../Theoretical Manual/Live_Load_Distribution_Factors_-_TxDOT_Method.htm">TxDOT 
 Bridge Design Manual</a>.</p>

<h3>Use (Number of Lanes)/(Number of Beams) as the Lower Limit for All 
 Distribution Factors</h3>

<p>There are some cases where the equations in LRFD 4.6.2.2 generate &quot;suspicious&quot; 
 (even negative) values for distribution factors, even when parameters 
 are within the specified range of applicability. If this option is checked, 
 PGSuper will override the equation if the result is less than the (Number 
 of Lanes)/(Number of Beams).</p>

<h3>Maximum Angular Deviation Between Girders</h3>

<p>The equations in LRFD 4.6.2.2 may be used to compute distribution factors 
 as long as &quot;Beams are parallel and have approximately the same stiffness&quot;. 
 However, no guidance is given as to when girders are &quot;parallel&quot;. 
 Enter the maximum allowable angular deviation between girder where you 
 consider girders to be &quot;parallel&quot;. </p>

<h3><span>Maximum Girder Stiffness Ratio</span></h3>

<p>The equations in LRFD 4.6.2.2 may be used to compute distribution factors 
 as long as &quot;Beams are parallel and have approximately the same stiffness&quot;. 
 However, no definition is given for &quot;same stiffness&quot;. Enter 
 the maximum percentage that Ix can vary between girders in a span.</p>

<h3><span>Location to Measure Girder Spacing For Distribution Factors</span></h3>

<p>Enter the fractional distance, measured from the ends of a girder's 
 span, for the location(s) where girder spacing is to be measured in order 
 to determine the value of S in distribution factor equations.PGSuper will 
 use the location of maximum deck width to determine the spacing used to 
 compute distribution factors. Some other notes about spacing used to compute 
 </p>

<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Spacings are measured normal to the alignment 
 at the stationing of the location determined above.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p><!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Most 
 LRFD distribution factor methods use a single value (S) for girder spacing 
 as a parameter. However, PGSuper allows spacing to vary (splay), if desired. 
 If the spacings to the left and right side of the girder are different, 
 PGSuper will use the average of the two adjacent spacings where a single 
 value is needed. The actual spacings are used when using the lever rule 
 or statical method.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that PGSuper allows you to directly input, or override how distribution 
 factors are computed for a project. See the <a href="../../Dialogs/Live_Load_Distibution_Factors.htm">Live 
 Load Distribution Factors</a> dialog for more information.</p>
