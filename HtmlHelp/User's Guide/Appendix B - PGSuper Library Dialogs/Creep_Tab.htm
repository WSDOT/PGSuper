<h1>Creep Tab</h1>

<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">General Creep Parameters</h2>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Time from stressing to prestress transfer</span></h3>

<p>Enter the number of hours from the time of stressing of the prestress 
 strands to prestress transfer. This parameter is used to compute the initial 
 relaxation loss prior to prestress transfer.</p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Time from prestress transfer until 
 temporary strand removal/diaphragm casting</span></h3>

<p>Enter the expected timing range from prestress transfer until temporary 
 strands are removed, or in the case of no temporary strands, when intermediate 
 diaphragms are constructed.</p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Time from prestress transfer until 
 slab casting or application of superimposed dead loads on noncomposite 
 girders</span></h3>

<p>Enter the expected timing range from prestress transfer until the slab 
 is cast or superimposed dead loads are applied in the case of noncomposite 
 girders.</p>

<h3>Variability between upper and lower bound camber</h3>

<p>Enter the reduction factor in percent (0-100) that will be used to reduce 
 the camber computed based on the min timing (input above) to compute lower 
 bound camber. Refer to the <a href="../../Theoretical Manual/Camber Calculations.htm#CamberVariability">Camber 
 Calculations section of the Theoretical Manual</a> for more information 
 on camber variability.</p>

<h3>Total Creep Duration</h3>

<p>Enter the total duration of creep from time of prestress transfer.</p>

<p>The construction timing has a large influence over the creep behavior 
 of a prestressed girder bridge. Given that real life is full of variation 
 that cannot be controlled at design time, it is difficult to accurately 
 predict the exact construction timing. If girders are erected sooner than 
 anticipated the camber will likely be much less and additional haunch 
 concrete will be needed to raise the deck to match profile grade. Conversely, 
 if girders are erected later than expected, excessive camber may result.</p>

<p>WSDOT as adopted a methodology of computing creep and camber based on 
 a minimum timing and the maximum permissible timing of construction. By 
 publishing the range of camber in the contract drawings, the contractor 
 has some idea as to the variability of camber and the haunch concrete 
 requirements and can use this information in making choices about the 
 construction schedule.</p>
