<h1>Connection Dialog</h1>

<p>The Connection Dialog allows you to edit the description of the connection 
 between the end of the girder and the substructure.</p>

<h2><span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Entry Name</span></span></h2>

<p>Each girder connection entry must have a unique name. The name may contain 
 any characters and can be up to 32 characters in length.</p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: normal;">Connection Properties</span></h2>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bearing Offset</span></h3>

<p>The bearing offset is the distance from the pier or abutment reference 
 line to the point of bearing on the girder (See Figure in Dialog). The 
 bearing offset may be measured normal to the pier or abutment reference 
 line or along the centerline of the girder. <span style="font-style: italic;">The 
 centerline of bearing is always parallel to the pier or abutment reference 
 line</span>.</p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">E</span></span>nd 
 Distance</span></h3>

<p>The girder end distance locates the end of the girder and can be measured 
 by the following:</p>

<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>From the Abutment/Pier Line, along the centerline 
 of the girder</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>From the Abutment/Pier Line, normal to the Abutment/Pier 
 Line</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>From the bearing, along the centerline of the 
 girder</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>From, and normal to, the bearing centerline</p></li>
</ul>

<p class=Tip>Note that at intermediate piers the value of End Distance 
 can never be larger than the Bearing Offset. However, if there is a large 
 skew, it is still possible to input valid library entry values, but have 
 the bearings located off of the girder. For example: In the figure below, 
 with a Bearing Offset = 9” measured along alignment; and End Distance 
 =9” measured from and normal to the Abutment/Pier Line. For this case 
 a zero skew would place the bearing at the end of the girder, a valid 
 condition. However, any non-zero skew would cause the bearing to be beyond 
 the end of the girder – negative cantilever - Not Good:</p>

<p class=Tip><img src="BearingEndDistanceError.gif"
					x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
					style="border: none;
							float: none;
							width: 289px;
							height: 265px;
							border-style: none;
							border-style: none;"
					width=289
					height=265
					border=0></p>

<p class=Tip>PGSuper will issue an error message when this condition occurs. 
 The issue can be fixed by increasing the end distance, or reducing the 
 girder skew angle.</p>

<h3>Support Width</h3>

<p>The width of the support, centered on the centerline of bearing. Half 
 the support width defines the distance from the centerline of bearing 
 to the face of support. Support width is measured along the centerline 
 of girder.</p>

<h2>End Diaphragm Dimensions</h2>

<p><span><span style="font-weight: normal;">End diaphragm dimensions, along 
 with the weight density for the currently-selected slab concrete type, 
 and the girder spacing/overhang width are used for calculating end diaphragm 
 loads. Diaphragms are assumed to be rectangular.</span></span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Diaphragm Height</span></h3>

<p>Enter the height of end diaphragms.</p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Diaphragm Width</span></h3>

<p>Enter the width of end diaphragms.</p>

<h2>Application of Diaphragm Loads</h2>

<p>PGSuper gives three options for applying end diaphragm loads to girders.</p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Apply Weight of Diaphragm Directly 
 Over C.L. Bearing</span></h3>

<p><span><span style="font-weight: normal;">This option causes the weight 
 of the diaphragm to be applied directly over the center of the girder 
 bearing and does not induce moment into the girder. The effects of the 
 load are included in the girder reaction.</span></span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Apply Weight of Diaphragm to Girder</span></h3>

<p><span>Apply the weight of the diaphragm to the girder at the specified 
 location. The location of the load (C.G. location) is measured from, and 
 normal to, the centerline of the abutment/pier and must be a positive 
 value. Moments due to offset of the load from the bearing are applied 
 to the girder.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Do Not Use Weight of Diaphragm in 
 Analysis</span></h3>

<p><span>I</span><span>gnore the effects of the diaphragm in the analysis. 
 Diaphragm loads are not applied to the girder or the reactions.</span></p>
