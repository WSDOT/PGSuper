<h1>Permanent Strands Tab</h1>

<p>This tab allows you to specify the prestressing strand grid for permanent 
 prestressing strands. </p>

<p>Here are some facts about permanent strands:</p>

<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>The strand grid defines all possible permanent 
 strand locations in a girder, and the order in which the strands are filled. 
 Another way to think of this is a <span style="font-style: italic;">template</span> 
 for strand placement. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Actual 
 strands are placed in a project by specifying the number of strands in 
 the <a HREF="../../Girder Editing Wizard/Prestressing.htm">Strands Tab 
 of the Girder Editing</a> dialog.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Permanent straight and harped strands are placed 
 and tensioned at casting time and remain in the girder for its lifetime. 
 </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Harped strands are bonded along the entire length 
 of the girder. </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Individual straight strands can be debonded if 
 allowed.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 style="margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Strand Grid</span></h2>

<p>Use the strand grid control to define the possible locations and fill 
 order of permanent straight and harped strands in the girder. </p>

<p>The strand location grid control allows you to add, modify, and delete 
 template locations for strands in a girder section. Double-click on the 
 grid row to edit the strand type and location. The following rules apply:</p>

<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>The origin of the coordinate system for strand 
 locations is the bottom center of the section as shown in the Figure above. 
 All PGSuper sections use this convention.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>X values cannot be negative. </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>If a non-zero X value is given, two strands are 
 added for the fill location: one strand at (X,Y) and another at (-X,Y). 
 This enforces the requirement that all strand templates must be symmetric 
 about the Y axis.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>If the X value of a strand coordinate is zero, 
 a single strand will be placed at that location.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Strands are added to the section in the given 
 Fill # sequence.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Strand locations may be added above the currently-selected 
 row by clicking the “Insert” button.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Strand locations may be appended the last row 
 of the list by clicking the “Append” button.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Strand locations may be removed by first selecting 
 the row and then clicking on the “Delete Row” button.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Strand locations may be edited by double clicking 
 on a row or by first selecting the row and then clicking on the “Edit” 
 button.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Strand locations may be moved in the fill sequence 
 by selecting the row and then clicking on the &quot;Move Up&quot; or &quot;Move 
 Down&quot; buttons.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>The fill sequence for harped strands can be reversed 
 by clicking on the &quot;Reverse Harp Strand Sequence&quot; button.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>The position of strands can be generated by clicking 
 on the &quot;<a HREF="GenerateStrands.htm">Generate Strand Positions</a>&quot; 
 button.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Strands must be located inside of the girder.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Vertical locations of harped strands must be within 
 the prescribed adjustment limits.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Use Different Harped Locations at Girder Ends</h3>

<p>This option allows you to define different locations of a harped strand 
 at the ends of the girder and at the harping points. This option is most 
 often used to describe the harped bundles at harping points used by WSDOT 
 I girders. </p>

<p>Note that you do not need to use this option if the relative distance 
 between strands is the same along the entire length of the girder. In 
 this case harping can be achieved by adjusting the vertical offset of 
 strand patterns at the girder ends and harping points.</p>

<h3>Debonding of Straight Strands</h3>

<p>You can select whether individual straight strands are allowed to be 
 debonded or not. Strands of type &quot;Straight&quot; may not be debonded. 
 Strands of type &quot;Straight-DB&quot; can be debonded by the design 
 algorithm or in the girder editor dialog.</p>

<h2>Strand Options</h2>

<h3>Coerce Odd Number of Harped Strands</h3>

<p>When selected, PGSuper will force (coerce) the lowest (first in the 
 fill order) pair of harped strands to alternate between a single strand 
 at X=0.0, and two strands at the prescribed +/- X values. This allows 
 a strand grid that contains only pairs of coordinates to place strands 
 one at a time.</p>

<p>Note that all end strands in the harped grid must have positive X values 
 (i.e., filled in pairs) when this feature is enabled.</p>

<p>This feature is used on some WSDOT I-Beams or Ribbed Girders with an 
 odd number of webs. </p>

<p>This feature was formally called &quot;Allow Odd Number of Harped Strands&quot; 
 </p>

<h2><span>Vertical Adjustment of Harped Grid</span></h2>

<p>If enabled, this option allows you to vertically offset the location 
 of harped strands at the girder ends or at harping points. </p>

<h3>Design Increment</h3>

<p>The increment defines the step size to be used by the automated design 
 algorithm when adjusting strand offsets. The increment must be less than 
 or equal to the maximum adjustment value.</p>

<p>If this value is zero, the design algorithm will make continuous adjustments 
 within the offset limits.</p>

<h3>Adjustment Limits</h3>

<p>These values define the range of possible uppermost and lowermost harped 
 strand Y locations. Harped strands may not lie above or below these limits. 
 Limits can be measured downward from the top of the girder or upward from 
 the bottom.</p>
