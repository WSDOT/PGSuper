<h1>Permanent Strands Tab</h1>

<p>This tab allows you to specify the prestressing strand grid for permanent 
 prestressing strands. </p>

<p>Here are some facts about permanent strands:</p>

<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>The strand grid defines all possible permanent 
 strand locations in a girder, and the order in which the strands are filled. 
 Another way to think of this is a <span style="font-style: italic;">template</span> 
 for strand placement. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Actual 
 strands are placed in a project by specifying the number of strands in 
 the <a HREF="../../Girder Editing Wizard/Prestressing.htm">Strands Tab 
 of the Girder Editing</a> dialog.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>There are two basic types of permanent strands. 
 </p></li>
	
	<ol style="list-style: decimal;"
		type=1>
		
		<li class=kadov-p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Straight 
 Permanent Strands</span> can be placed anywhere within a girder section 
 and are straight along the entire girder.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Web Strands</span> 
 are permanent strands that can only be placed within the thinnest portion 
 of a girder section's web(s). Web Strand templates have the unique capability 
 to be vertically adjusted within the web region. There are two types of 
 Web Strands: <span style="font-style: italic;">Harped Strands</span> and 
 <span style="font-style: italic;">Straight-Web</span> strands. Harped 
 strands are draped at the girders harping points, and Straight-Web strands 
 are straight along the entire length of the girder.</p></li>
	</ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Permanent strands are placed and tensioned at 
 casting time and remain in the girder for its lifetime. </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Harped and Straight-Web strands are bonded along 
 the entire length of the girder. </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Individual straight strands can be debonded if 
 the allow debonding option is selected.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 style="margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Strand Grid</span></h2>

<p>Use the strand grid control to define a template of possible strand 
 locations and fill order of permanent straight and web strands in the 
 girder. </p>

<p>The strand location grid control allows you to add, modify, and delete 
 template locations for strands in a girder section. Double-click on the 
 grid row to edit the strand type and location. The following rules apply:</p>

<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>The origin of the coordinate system for strand 
 locations is the bottom center of the section as shown in the Figure above. 
 All PGSuper sections use this convention.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>X values cannot be negative. </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>If a non-zero X value is given, two strands are 
 added for the fill location: one strand at (X,Y) and another at (-X,Y). 
 This enforces the requirement that all strand templates must be symmetric 
 about the Y axis.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>If the X value of a strand coordinate is zero, 
 a single strand will be placed at that location.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Strands are added to the section in the given 
 Fill # sequence.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Strand locations may be added above the currently-selected 
 row by clicking the “Insert” button.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Strand locations may be appended the last row 
 of the list by clicking the “Append” button.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Strand locations may be removed by first selecting 
 the row and then clicking on the “Delete Row” button.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Strand locations may be edited by double clicking 
 on a row or by first selecting the row and then clicking on the “Edit” 
 button.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Strand locations may be moved in the fill sequence 
 by selecting the row and then clicking on the &quot;Move Up&quot; or &quot;Move 
 Down&quot; buttons.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>The fill sequence for harped strands can be reversed 
 by clicking on the &quot;Reverse Harp Strand Sequence&quot; button.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>The position of strands can be generated by clicking 
 on the &quot;<a HREF="GenerateStrands.htm">Generate Strand Positions</a>&quot; 
 button.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Straight Permanent strands must be located inside 
 of the girder.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Web strands must lie within the thinnest portion 
 of the girder's web(s), and within the specified allowable vertical offsets.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Allowable vertical locations of web strands can 
 be controlled by the prescribed adjustment limits.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Use Different Harped Locations at Girder Ends</h3>

<p>This option allows you to define different locations of a harped strand 
 at the ends of the girder and at the harping points. This option is most 
 often used to describe the harped bundles at harping points used by WSDOT 
 I girders. </p>

<p>Note that you do not need to use this option if the relative distance 
 between strands is the same along the entire length of the girder. In 
 this case harping can be achieved by adjusting the vertical offset of 
 strand patterns at the girder ends and harping points.</p>

<h3>Debonding of Straight Strands</h3>

<p>The Edit Strand Location Dialog allows selection of whether individual 
 permanent straight strands are allowed to be debonded or not.</p>

<p>When shown in the permanent strand grid, strands of type &quot;Straight&quot; 
 may not be debonded. Strands of type &quot;Straight-DB&quot; can be debonded 
 by the design algorithm or in the girder editor dialog.</p>

<h2>Strand Options</h2>

<h3>Coerce Odd Number of Web Strands</h3>

<p>When selected, PGSuper will force (coerce) the lowest (first in the 
 fill order) pair of web strands to alternate between a single strand at 
 X=0.0, and two strands at the prescribed +/- X values. This allows a strand 
 grid that contains only pairs of coordinates to place strands one at a 
 time.</p>

<p>Note that all end strands in the web strand grid must have positive 
 X values (i.e., filled in pairs) when this feature is enabled.</p>

<p>This feature is used on some WSDOT I-Beams or Ribbed Girders with an 
 odd number of webs. </p>

<h2><span>Vertical Adjustment of Web Strand Grid</span></h2>

<p>If enabled, this option allows harped and straight-web strand templates 
 to be vertically offset. Harped strands can be offset differently at the 
 girder ends or at harping points, thus forming the harped drape. Straight 
 web strands use a single offset along the entire girder length.</p>

<h3>Design Increment</h3>

<p>In general, web strands can be adjusted continuously up and down within 
 their adjustment limits through user-input adjustment values.</p>

<p>The design increment defines the step size to be used by the automated 
 design algorithm when adjusting strand offsets. The increment must be 
 less than or equal to the maximum adjustment value.</p>

<p>If this value is zero, the design algorithm will make continuous adjustments 
 within the offset limits.</p>

<h3>Adjustment Limits</h3>

<p>These values define the range of possible uppermost and lowermost web 
 strand Y locations. Web strands may not lie above or below these limits. 
 Limits can be measured downward from the top of the girder or upward from 
 the bottom.</p>
