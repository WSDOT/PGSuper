<h1>Designing Long Girders for Stability</h1>

<p>As girders become longer, lifting and hauling them becomes more and 
 more challenging. In fact, instability from lifting and handling often 
 becomes the controlling factor when designing beams over 100 feet in length.</p>

<p>To help designers better understand how the factors of safety against 
 cracking, girder failure, and truck rollover are effected by the location 
 of the lifting device and truck support locations, PGSuper plots the relationships 
 in the Girder Stability View.</p>

<p>If the stability of the girder is controlling the design, and PGSuper's 
 automated Girder Designer isn't zeroing in on an acceptable solution, 
 you will have to adjust the design manually.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"
	align=left>For the case of lifting the girder from the casting bed, 
 the Factor of Safety Against Failure (FSf) is a function of the lifting 
 locations. Temporary top strands have negligible effect on this value. 
 The first thing to do is analyze the girder without temporary top strands, 
 and adjust the lifting locations away from the ends until FSf exceeds 
 the minimum value (1.5). The results of this analysis give you a lifting 
 location. The required concrete release strength for the girder without 
 temporary top strands can be back calculated from the maximum tensile 
 or compressive stresses and the corresponding allowable stress. Of course, 
 moving the lifting locations away from the ends increases the required 
 release strength. Most large girders can be handled without temporary 
 top strands, at the expense of higher release strengths. This is because 
 compression in the bottom flange at the harp point usually governs. With 
 smaller girders, this may not be true, since tension in the top becomes 
 more of an issue. </p>

<p style="text-align: left;"
	align=left>The next step is to analyze the Factor of Safety Against 
 Cracking (FScr) at shipping. For large girders, temporary top strands 
 are normally required to bring FScr to 1.0. Temporary top strands have 
 only an indirect affect on the Factor of Safety Against Rollover (FSr), 
 which is a function of the load and roll stiffness of the truck. Temporary 
 top strands allow the truck supports to be moved away from the ends while 
 still maintaining FScr at 1.0 or better. Moving the supports away from 
 the ends improves FSr. In any case, this analysis allows you to determine 
 the truck support locations, the number of temporary top strands required 
 for shipping, and the minimum 28 day concrete strength.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"
	align=left>Since the temporary top strands will be needed for shipping, 
 reanalyze the lifting configuration assuming the temporary top strands 
 are tensioned prior to the release of prestress. This allows you to move 
 the lifting locations closer to the ends while still maintaining adequate 
 stability. Since the temporary top strands have almost no effect on FSf, 
 moving the lifting locations closer to the ends will cause FSf to dip 
 below 1.5. However, the temporary top strands significantly improve FScr. 
 In this analysis, simply adjust the lifting locations towards the ends 
 until FScr is at 1.5 or slightly above. The eccentricity of the temporary 
 top strands, along with moving the lifting locations closer to the ends, 
 allows you to reduce the required release strength. </p>

<p style="text-align: left;"
	align=left>The important thing to realize is that the primary variables 
 in the calculations are the lift loop locations, the truck support locations, 
 and the number of temporary top strands. Those are what you adjust to 
 get the proper factors of safety. The concrete strength requirements are 
 only output values, and are only a problem if they are outside the bounds 
 that are defined as achievable.</p>
