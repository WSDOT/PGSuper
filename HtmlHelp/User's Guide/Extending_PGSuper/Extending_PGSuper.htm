<p>The capabilities of PGSuper can be extended with plug-ins and extensions. 
 Plug-ins and extensions are typically developed by third parties and are 
 optional components that are not necessarily required to use PGSuper.</p>

<p>Many WSDOT and TxDOT-specific features are implemented with plug-ins 
 and extensions. During the installation process you had the choice of 
 installing optional WSDOT and TxDOT components. These components include 
 specialized reporting and data exporting capabilities.</p>

<p>PGSuper can also be extended by third parties including other Departments 
 of Transportation and private software developers. Plug-ins are easier 
 to develop than extensions, but have limited capabilities. Extensions 
 on the other hand are much more complicated but have virtually unlimited 
 capabilities</p>

<h2>Plug-ins</h2>

<p>PGSuper supports three types of plug-ins; Project Importers, Data Importers, 
 and Data Exporters. </p>

<p>Project Importers integrate into the New Project dialog under the PGSuper 
 Project Importers node. Project importers create a new PGSuper Project 
 by importing data from an external data source such as a database or data 
 file from another similar application. </p>

<p>PGSuper Data Importers differ from Project Importers in that they import 
 data into an open project. Data Imports are found on the File | Import 
 menu. </p>

<p>PGSuper Data Exporters are found on the File | Export menu. They can 
 be used to export data from PGSuper to an external data source such as 
 a database, file, or another application. Plug-ins are limited to these 
 simple tasks.</p>

<h2>Extensions</h2>

<p>Extensions integrate into the PGSuper interface in many different ways 
 and can offer the user many different capabilities. An extension can add 
 commands to a menu, add new drop-down menus, add buttons to toolbars and 
 add new toolbars, can add any type of view displaying any type of data, 
 and can read and write extension-specific data. Extensions can also add 
 new report types into the PGSuper reporting system including reports that 
 need specialized user interfaces to set reporting parameters.</p>

<h2>Developing PGSuper Plug-ins and Extensions</h2>

<p>If you would like to develop Plug-ins and Extensions for PGSuper, please 
 contact WSDOT for details.</p>
