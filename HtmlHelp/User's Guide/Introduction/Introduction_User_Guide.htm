<h1>Chapter 1 - Introduction</h1>

<p>PGSuper (<span style="color: #ff0000;">P</span>restressed <span style="color: #ff0000;">G</span>irder 
 <span style="color: #ff0000;">SUPER</span>structures) is Precast-Prestressed 
 Girder design, analysis, and load rating software for the AASHTO LRFD 
 Bridge Design Specification. PGSuper is jointly developed by the Washington 
 State and Texas Departments of Transportation.</p>

<p>PGSuper designs and checks precast-prestressed girder bridges in accordance 
 with the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specification. Load ratings are in 
 accordance with the AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation. PGSuper is easily 
 configured to evaluate a variety of localized criteria such as those defined 
 in the WSDOT and TxDOT Bridge Design Manuals. The flexural design feature 
 computes the number and configuration of prestressing strands, determines 
 the minimum concrete release strength and the minimum 28 day concrete 
 strength. Flexural design also considers the effects of girder lifting 
 and transportation to determine concrete strengths and to insure girder 
 stability during handling. The shear design feature determines the number, 
 size, and spacing of transverse reinforcement for vertical shear, horizontal 
 shear, splitting, and strand confinement. Specification checking evaluates 
 girders for compliance with strength, service, and detailing criteria. 
 Girders are evaluated for stresses and stability during handling and transportation. 
 Temporary prestressing to improve stability during handling and shipping, 
 control camber, and reduce concrete release strengths are also considered. 
 The capabilities and constraints of local fabricators can been accounted 
 for in this software product. </p>

<p>PGSuper supports the following families of girder sections</p>

<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>I-Beams</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>U-Beams</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Deck Bulb Tees</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Box Beams</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Slabs (voided and solid)</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Multi-stem Beams (ribbed girders)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>PGSuper provides a <span style="font-style: italic;">Bridge-centric</span> 
 approach to bridge engineering software. Traditional bridge engineering 
 software requires the engineer to focus his/her attention on cryptic data 
 files, verbose problem oriented languages, or data driven graphical user 
 interfaces. The <span style="font-style: italic;">Bridge-centric</span> 
 approach employs principles of visualization and direct manipulation resulting 
 in software that enables the engineer to concentrate on the bridge at 
 hand.</p>

<p>PGSuper supports plug-ins and extensions. Plug-ins are simple software 
 components that provide data import and export capabilities. Extensions 
 are more complex. Extensions can integrated into the PGSuper user interface 
 and provide new and enhanced capabilities.</p>

<h2>About this Manual</h2>

<h3>Organization</h3>

<p>The chapters in the User Guide are organized in the following way:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>The Introduction chapter gives an overview of 
 PGSuper and the manual. In addition, all the menus and toolbar commands 
 are described in one convenient location.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>The chapters in the middle sections are arranged 
 in the order of tasks typically performed by an engineer. These tasks 
 include, creating a new project, editing the structure, performing a design, 
 and reviewing analysis results.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>The last chapters provided information for customizing 
 PGSuper.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>The appendices provide detailed information for 
 all PGSuper inputs.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Conventions</h3>

<p>The PGSuper documentation uses a few special symbols and conventions.</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Specific text you are to type in and the names 
 of commands to choose are shown in <span style="font-weight: bold;">bold</span>.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Keys are frequently used in combinations or sequences. 
 For example, SHIFT+F1 (with a + sign) means to hold down the SHIFT key 
 while pressing F1, and ALT,F,A (with comma) means to press and release 
 each of these in order: first ALT, then F, and then A.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Menu selections are separated by a vertical bar. 
 <span style="font-weight: normal;">File | Open</span> means, select the 
 Open command from the File menu.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>To choose a command from a menu, you can use the 
 mouse or press a key combination. In procedures, key sequences follow 
 the menu and command names. For example: Select <span style="font-weight: normal;">File 
 | Open </span>(ALT,F,O).</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>For commands with a toolbar button alternative, 
 the button appears next to the command.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>For operations with a context (right click) menu 
 alternative, a mouse symbol <font style="font-family: Wingdings;"
									face=Wingdings>8</font> appears next 
 to the command.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Notes and Tips have a shaded background, as seen 
 here.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CTip><p CLASS=Tip><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</span><span 
 style="font-weight: normal;"> This is a note</span></p></li>
</ul>
