<h1>Defining the Roadway</h1>

<p>Highway bridge structures are associated with a roadway alignment. The 
 structure geometry is dependent on geometry of the alignment. PGSuper 
 uses the this geometry to determine girder lengths, applicability for 
 live load distribution calculations, calculating the required haunch dimension, 
 and many other parameters.</p>

<p>The roadway is described on the Horizontal, Profile, and Superelevation 
 tabs of the Alignment Description Dialog.</p>

<h2>Horizontal Alignment</h2>

<p>The horizontal alignment can be straight or a series of horizontal curves, 
 including entry and/or exit spirals. For a straight alignment, simply 
 enter the initial direction and remove all rows from the Curve table.</p>

<p>For curved alignments, enter the back tangent bearing of the first curve 
 in the Initial Direction field. Enter the remaining curve parameters in 
 the Curve table. For alignments with multiple curves, add the curve parameters 
 into the Curve table. The forward tangent of the previous curve is considered 
 to be the back tangent of the current curve.</p>

<p>Horizontal curve parameters include the PI Station, Forward Tangent 
 Bearing or Delta Angle, Radius of the circular curve, and Entry and Exit 
 Spiral lengths.</p>

<p>A PI angle point can be modeled by defining a horizontal curve with 
 a Radius and Entry and Exit Spiral Lengths of zero.</p>

<p>The coordinate of a reference point may be defined. This defines a coordinate 
 system for all coordinate geometry computations.</p>

<h2>Profile</h2>

<p>The profile can be described by a straight grade or a series of vertical 
 curves and PVIs. For a straight grade, enter a station, elevation, and 
 grade of the profile.</p>

<p>For a profile with vertical curves, describe the initial grade entering 
 the first curve with a station, elevation and grade. Then, in the curve 
 table, describe each vertical curve with a PVI Station, Exit Grade, and 
 two half lengths of the curve (L1 and L2).</p>

<p>For profiles with multiple vertical curves, the exit grade of the previous 
 curve becomes the entry grade of the next curve.</p>

<p>The total length of the vertical curve is L1 + L2. L1 is the distance 
 from the beginning of the curve to the PVI and L2 is the length from PVI 
 to the end of the curve. This allows for the modeling of non-symmetrical 
 vertical curves.</p>

<p class=Tip>TIP: The reference point may be input as the PVI of the first 
 vertical curve.</p>

<p class=Tip>TIP: If you have a symmetrical vertical curve, enter the total 
 curve length in the L1 field and leave the L2 field blank.</p>

<p class=Tip>TIP: If you have a PVI without a vertical curve, leave the 
 L1 and L2 fields blank.</p>

<h2>Superelevations</h2>

<p>The cross section of the roadway/bridge deck is defined by a series 
 of super elevation descriptions. Each section is defined by a station, 
 left slope, right slope, and crown point offset. Negative slopes are measured 
 downwards from the crown point. The crown point offset is the distance 
 that the crown point is offset from the profile line. Positive offsets 
 are to the right.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Slopes and crown slope offsets are 
 linearly interpolated between stations. A super elevation transition can 
 be modeled by using a series of sections.</span></p>
