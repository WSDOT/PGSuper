<h1>Understanding the Bridge Model View</h1>

<p>The Bridge Model View gives a global perspective of your bridge structure. 
 The view is divided into two panes. The upper pane contains the plan view 
 of the structure. The lower pane contains the cross section. The cross 
 section can be taken at any point along the bridge. The horizontal bar 
 between the Plan and Section views may be moved to resize the views.</p>

<p><img src="BridgeModelView.GIF"
		x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
		style="border: none;
				border-style: none;
				width: 920px;
				height: 530px;
				float: none;"
		width=920
		height=530
		border=0></p>

<h2>Selecting the Cross Section</h2>

<p>The cross section my be selected by dragging the section cut tool in 
 the Plan View. A precise section can be specified by double clicking on 
 the section cut tool and entering a station. </p>

<p>When selected, the section cut tool turns red. Select the section cut 
 tool by clicking on it with the mouse. You may use the left and right 
 arrow keys to move the section cut tool one tenth of the span length.</p>

<h2>Selecting Bridge Components</h2>

<p>The various bridge components can be selected by clicking on them with 
 the mouse. When selected, the component turns red and is filled with a 
 red hashing. In the figure below, Girder A is selected. </p>

<p>The spans, piers, girders, deck, alignment, and section cut tool can 
 all be selected. </p>

<p class=Tip>Tip: You can edit the currently selected item by pressing 
 the Enter key</p>

<p class=Tip>Tip: You can advance the selection from pier to span to pier 
 using the left and right arrow keys.</p>

<p class=Tip>Tip: You can advance the selection from girder to girder using 
 the up and down arrow keys</p>

<p><img src="SelectedGirder.GIF"
		x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
		style="border: none;
				border-style: none;
				width: 919px;
				height: 533px;
				float: none;"
		width=919
		height=533
		border=0></p>

<h2>Viewing Spans</h2>

<p>At the top of the view, there is a control bar that can be used to set 
 the range of spans to be viewed. For large bridges, with many spans, it 
 is difficult to see details when viewing the entire bridge. Use the up/down 
 arrows to select the range of spans to display.</p>

<h2>View Elements</h2>

<p>There are several noteworthy elements of the views. These elements provide 
 at a glance information about the bridge model.</p>

<h4>North Arrow</h4>

<p>The orientation of the bridge is indicated by the North arrow found 
 in the upper left corner of the Plan View. The view can be configured 
 so that North is always up or North is oriented to make the bridge fit 
 best into the view.</p>

<h4>Tool Tips</h4>

<p>When the mouse hovers over many of the view elements such as girders 
 and piers, a tool tip window will be displayed. This tool tip contains 
 detailed information about the element.</p>

<h4>Boundary Conditions</h4>

<p>The boundary conditions are indicated by a small symbol on the right 
 hand side of a pier. For example, the symbol &quot;Ca&quot; indicates 
 that a the girders are modeled as continuous after deck placement.</p>

<h2>Context Editing (<font style="font-family: Wingdings;"
							face=Wingdings>8</font>)</h2>

<p>There are several ways to edit the bridge model from this view. The 
 Introduction section introduced you to the commands on the main menu and 
 the toolbar equivalents. In this section we will discuss context editing.</p>

<p>Each pane has context menus for the various items that can be selected. 
 By right clicking on an item, you are presented with a context menu that 
 provides quick access to functions related to that item. For example, 
 by right clicking on a girder you can quickly start a design for that 
 girder or create a report.</p>

<h2>Customizing the View</h2>

<p>The Bridge Model View can be customized by enabling and disabling the 
 various annotations. To customize the view select View | View Settings 
 | Bridge Model View (ALT,V,V,B). This will bring up the View Settings 
 dialog.</p>

<p>On the Plan tab, you can enable/disable the pier labels and the girder 
 labels and indicate how North is to be displayed.</p>

<p><img src="viewsettingsplan.bmp"
		x-maintain-ratio=FALSE
		style="border-style: none;
				float: none;
				width: 344px;
				height: 215px;
				border-style: none;"
		width=344
		height=215
		border=0></p>

<p>On the Section tab, you can enable/disable the girder labels and the 
 cross section dimensions.</p>

<p><img src="viewsettingssection.bmp"
		x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
		style="margin-top: 0px;
				margin-bottom: 0px;
				margin-left: 0px;
				margin-right: 0px;
				width: 344px;
				height: 200px;
				float: none;
				border-style: none;
				border-style: none;"
		width=344
		height=200
		border=0></p>
