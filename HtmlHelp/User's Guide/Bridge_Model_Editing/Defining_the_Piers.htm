<h1>Framing</h1>

<p>The Framing tab is used to frame the bridge starting with the lay out 
 of the spans and piers. Each span and pier can be &quot;drilled into&quot; 
 to further define connections, boundary conditions, and girder spacing.</p>

<p>In the grid, enter the pier station and orientation. The pier-to-pier 
 span length is computed and shown in the Span rows. </p>

<p><img src="piers.bmp"
		x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
		style="border: none;
				border-style: none;
				float: none;
				width: 685px;
				height: 527px;"
		width=685
		height=527
		border=0></p>

<h2>Pier Layout</h2>

<p>Piers are described by their station and orientation. The orientation 
 can be a bearing (e.g. N 34 23 32.1 W), a skew angle (e.g. &quot;-35&quot;, 
 or &quot;12 02 34.5 R&quot;), or the word &quot;Normal&quot;. Skew angles 
 are defined as left (L) or right (R) looking up station. Positive skews 
 are counterclockwise.</p>

				height: 195px;
				margin-top: 0px;
				margin-bottom: 0px;
				margin-left: 0px;
				margin-right: 0px;
				border-style: none;
				border-style: none;"
		width=367
		height=195
		border=0></p>

<p>The buttons below the grid can be used to add spans, remove spans, and 
 to layout the spans by span length.</p>

<p>The Edit Details buttons in the grid open a dialog for further editing 
 the spans and piers.</p>

<h2>Alignment Offset</h2>

<p>The bridge reference line can be offset from the alignment. Typically 
 the bridge reference line is the centerline of the bridge, but it can 
 be any convenient line. The bridge reference line is a constant distance 
 from and parallels the alignment.</p>

<p><img src="AlignmentOffset.gif"

		style="border: none;
				width: 584px;
				height: 268px;
				float: none;"
		width=584
		height=268
		border=0></p>

<h2>Edit Pier Details</h2>

<p>Pier details are grouped into three categories. The general layout of 
 the pier is given on the General tab. This the same information that is 
 entered into the framing grid. Options are provided for adjusting the 
 bridge geometry when the station of a pier changes. The bridge can be 
 simply moved or the length of the adjacent spans can be adjusted.</p>

<h3>General</h3>

<p><img src="Pier_General.bmp"
		x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
		style="border: none;
				border-style: none;
				float: none;
				width: 577px;
				height: 624px;"
		width=577
		height=624
		border=0></p>

<h3>Connections</h3>

<p>The connection geometry and boundary conditions on each side of the 
 pier are described on the Connections tab. The Connection geometry is 
 a connection object taken from the Connections library. It describes among 
 other things, the location of the centerline bearing measured from the 
 centerline of pier and the distance from the centerline of bearing to 
 the end of the girder.</p>

<p>The connection boundary conditions describes the connectivity between 
 spans.</p>

<p>The connection geometry and boundary conditions can be constrained to 
 be the same on both sides of the pier or each side of the pier may have 
 a different connection configuration.</p>

<p class=Tip>NOTE: The connection boundary conditions are ignored if the 
 analysis mode is set to Simple Span. See <a HREF="../AnalysisControls/AnalysisControls.htm">Chapter 
 7</a> for more details.</p>

<p><img src="Pier_Connections.bmp"
		x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
		style="border: none;
				border-style: none;
				float: none;
				width: 577px;
				height: 548px;
				border-style: none;"
		width=577
		height=548
		border=0></p>

<h3>Girder Spacing</h3>

<p>The number of girder, girder spacing, and transverse position of the 
 girders are described on the Girder Spacing tab.</p>

<p>The input for the number of girders and girder spacing disabled when 
 they are constant for the entire bridge. You can either go back to the 
 General tab of the Bridge Description dialog and select the options to 
 permit span-by-span definition or you can click on the hyperlinks adjacent 
 to the controls. Likewise, you can change to defining these properties 
 for the entire bridge by clicking on the hyperlinks.</p>

<p><img src="Pier_GirderSpacing.bmp"
		x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
		style="border: none;
				border-style: none;
				float: none;
				width: 577px;
				height: 624px;"
		width=577
		height=624
		border=0></p>

<h2>Edit Span Details</h2>

<h3>General</h3>

<p>Span details are grouped into three categories as well. The pier-to-pier 
 span length is described on the General tab. When you change the span 
 length, only the length of this span is changed. The stations of all piers 
 after this span are adjusted to maintain the other span lengths.</p>

<p><img src="Span_General.bmp"
		x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
		style="border: none;
				width: 623px;
				height: 506px;
				float: none;
				border-style: none;
				border-style: none;"
		width=623
		height=506
		border=0></p>

<h3>Connections</h3>

<p>Connection geometry and boundary conditions are described on the Connections 
 tab. These boundary conditions are for the start and end of the span. 
 If the boundary conditions are the same for both sides of a pier, changing 
 them here will cause them to change on the other side of the pier as well. 
 A message will be shown alerting you of changes that occur because of 
 changes made here.</p>

<p><img src="Span_Connections.bmp"
		x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
		style="border: none;
				float: none;
				border-style: none;
				width: 664px;
				height: 506px;
				border-style: none;"
		width=664
		height=506
		border=0></p>

<h3>Girders</h3>

<p>The number of girders, girder type, girder spacing, and transverse position 
 of the girders are all defined on the Girders tab.</p>

<p><img src="Span_Girders.bmp"
		x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
		style="border: none;
				border-style: none;
				float: none;
				width: 664px;
				height: 566px;"
		width=664
		height=566
		border=0></p>

<p>Girder names and spacing can be grouped as needed. In the example above 
 there are three spacing groups; one between girders A and B, one between 
 B and F, and one between F and G.</p>

<p>To create groupings:</p>

<p>1) Click on a column heading</p>

<p>2) Right click and choose the Expand command. This will expand a grouping 
 such that there is a column for every member of the group.</p>

<p>3) Select a group of adjacent columns, right click, and choose the Join 
 command. This will group the columns together.</p>

<p>As you can see from the example above, grouping is a good way to minimize 
 input. Only three girder spacings needed to be input for the six actual 
 spaces.</p>
