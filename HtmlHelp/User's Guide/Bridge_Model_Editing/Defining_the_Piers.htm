<h1>Framing</h1>

<p>The Framing tab is used to frame the bridge starting with the lay out 
 of the spans and piers. Each span and pier can be &quot;drilled into&quot; 
 to further define connections, boundary conditions, and girder spacing.</p>

<p>In the grid, enter the pier station and orientation. The pier-to-pier 
 span length is computed and shown in the Span rows. </p>

<h2>Abutment/Pier Layout</h2>

<p>Abutments and piers are described with a reference line, called an Abutment 
 Line or Pier Line. The Abutment/Pier Line is located at any station along 
 the alignment and has a specified orientation. The Abutment/Pier Line 
 is usually selected such that it represents a meaningful line on the abutment 
 or pier such as the back of pavement seat (BPS), end of wearing surface 
 (EWS), centerline of pier, or centerline of bearing. The orientation of 
 the Abutment/Pier Line is defined with a bearing (e.g. N 34 23 32.1 W), 
 a skew angle (e.g. &quot;-35&quot;, or &quot;12 02 34.5 R&quot;), or the 
 keyword &quot;Normal&quot; to indicate it is perpendicular to the alignment 
 at the specified station.. Skew angles are defined as left (L) or right 
 (R) looking up station. Positive skews are counterclockwise.</p>

<p>The buttons below the grid can be used to add spans, remove spans, and 
 to layout the spans by span length.</p>

<p>The Edit Details buttons in the grid open a dialog for further editing 
 the spans and piers as described below.</p>

<h2>Bridge Line Alignment Offset</h2>

<p>The bridge reference line can be offset from the alignment. Typically 
 the bridge reference line is the centerline of the bridge, but it can 
 be any convenient line. The bridge reference line is a constant distance 
 from and parallels the alignment.</p>

<h2>Edit Abutment/Pier Details</h2>

<p>Press the Edit Abutment/Pier Details button is press in the framing 
 grid to define additional details. Details are grouped into three categories; 
 General, Connections, and Girder Spacing.</p>

<p>The general layout of the pier is defined on the General tab. This the 
 same information that is entered into the framing grid. Options are provided 
 for adjusting the bridge geometry when the station of a pier changes. 
 The bridge can be moved or the length of the adjacent spans can be adjusted.</p>

<h3>General</h3>

<p><img src="Pier_General.bmp"
		x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
		style="border: none;
				float: none;
				border-style: none;
				border-style: none;
				width: 768px;
				height: 684px;"
		width=768
		height=684
		border=0></p>

<h3>Connections</h3>

<p>The boundary condition and geometry are described on this tab. </p>

<p>The boundary conditions describes the connectivity between spans. Customary 
 boundary conditions can be modeled including hinged, roller, and continuous 
 after deck placement.</p>

<p class=Tip>NOTE: The boundary conditions at all piers are treated as 
 hinged connections if the analysis mode is set to Simple Span. See <a 
 href="../AnalysisControls/AnalysisControls.htm">Chapter 7</a> for more 
 details.</p>

<p>The Connection Definition describes the geometric relationship between 
 the Abutment/Pier Line defined on the General tab and the location of 
 the centerline of bearing line at the ends of the girder. The geometry 
 of the connection region is defined by two parameters; Bearing Offset 
 and End Distance. The bearing offset defines the distance from the Abutment/Pier 
 Line to the centerline of bearing line. This distance can be measured 
 normal to the Abutment/Pier Line or along the centerline of the girder. 
 </p>

<p class=Tip>NOTE: When measured along the centerline of the girder, and 
 the girders are not parallel, there will be a unique centerline of bearing 
 line for each girder.</p>

<p>The End Distance locates the end of the girder. The span length and 
 overall length of precast prestressed girders are usually different. The 
 bearing points are typically a short distance from the end of the girder 
 thereby making the span length slightly less than the girder length. The 
 end distance describes where the end of the girder is located in relation 
 to either the Abutment/Pier Line or the centerline bearing line. The end 
 distance can be measured along the centerline of the girder or normal 
 to either the Abutment/Pier Line or the centerline bearing.</p>

<p>The Support Width defines the width of the bearing area. This parameter 
 is used to located the face of support (one-half of the support width 
 from the centerline bearing) for computations related to shear.</p>

<p>The size and method of modeling the dead load of diaphragms is also 
 described on this tab. The height and width of the diaphragm cross section 
 is described. The area of this rectangle times the tributary width of 
 the girder is multiplied by the unit weight of the slab concrete to determine 
 the dead load of the diaphragm. The dead load can be ignored, applied 
 directly over the centerline of bearing so that it does not produce any 
 stress in the girder, or applied at specified distance from the Abutment/Pier 
 Line so that it produces moment and shear in the girder. At intermediate 
 piers with continuous connections, when there is a single diaphragm connection 
 the ends of the girders on both sides of the pier, divide the width of 
 the diaphragm at the Pier Line and enter the appropriate amount on the 
 Back and Ahead sides of the pier.</p>

<p class=Tip>NOTE: Standard connection geometry and diaphragm sizes can 
 be defined and stored in the Connections Library. Press the Copy Connection 
 Definition from Library button and select a previously defined connection. 
 The connection data is copied into this tab. The data on this tab is not 
 linked to the library entry so subsequent changes to the library entry 
 are not reflected here.</p>

		width=768

<h3>Girder Spacing</h3>

<p>The number of girders, slab offset, girder spacing, and transverse position 
 of the girders are described on the Girder Spacing tab.</p>

<p>The input for the number of girders, slab offset, and girder spacing 
 disabled when they are constant for the entire bridge. You can go back 
 to the General tab of the Bridge Description dialog and select the options 
 to permit span-by-span definition or you can click on the underlined text 
 (hyperlinks) adjacent to the input controls to activate span-by-span definitions. 
 Similarly, you can input values in this dialog and then click on the hyperlinks 
 to apply them to the entire bridge.</p>

<p><img src="Pier_GirderSpacing.bmp"
		x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
		style="border: none;
				float: none;
				border-style: none;
				border-style: none;
				width: 768px;
				height: 684px;"
		width=768
		height=684
		border=0></p>

<h2>Edit Span Details</h2>

<p>Span details are grouped into four categories; General, Connection at 
 Start of Span, Connection at End of Span, and Girders.</p>

<h3>General</h3>

<p>The span length between Abutment/Pier Lines, measured along the alignment, 
 is described on the General tab. When you change the span length, only 
 the length of this span is changed. The stations of all piers after this 
 span are adjusted to maintain the other span lengths.</p>

<p><img src="Span_General.bmp"
		x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
		style="border: none;
				float: none;
				border-style: none;
				border-style: none;
				width: 768px;
				height: 684px;"
		width=768
		height=684
		border=0></p>

<h3>Connections</h3>

<p>The connections at the start and end of the span are defined on the 
 connections tabs. These is the same connection data found on the Connections 
 tab of the Pier Details dialog.</p>

<p><img src="Span_Connections.bmp"
		x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
		style="border: none;
				float: none;
				border-style: none;
				border-style: none;
				width: 1542px;
				height: 684px;"
		width=1542
		height=684
		border=0></p>

<h3>Girders</h3>

<p>The number of girders, slab offset, girder type, girder spacing, and 
 transverse position of the girders are all defined on the Girders tab.</p>

<p><img src="Span_Girders.bmp"
		x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
		style="border: none;
				float: none;
				border-style: none;
				border-style: none;
				width: 768px;
				height: 684px;"
		width=768
		height=684
		border=0></p>

<p>Girder names and spacing can be grouped as needed. In the example above 
 there are three spacing groups; one between girders A and B, one between 
 B and F, and one between F and G.</p>

<p>To create groupings:</p>

<p>1) Click on a column heading</p>

<p>2) Right click and choose the Expand command. This will expand a grouping 
 such that there is a column for every member of the group.</p>

<p>3) Select a group of adjacent columns, right click, and choose the Join 
 command. This will group the columns together.</p>

<p>As you can see from the example above, grouping is a good way to minimize 
 input. Only three girder spacings needed to be input for the six actual 
 spaces.</p>
