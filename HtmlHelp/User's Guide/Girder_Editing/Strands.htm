<h1>Strands</h1>

<p>Use the Strands tab on the Girder Details dialog to describe the filling 
 of strands, jacking forces, type of strands, and vertical adjustment of 
 adjustable prestressing strand locations.</p>

<h2>Describing Prestressing Strands in a Girder</h2>

<p>Pretensioned prestressing is described by filling allowable locations 
 of straight, adjustable, and temporary prestressing strands, and the jacking 
 forces imparted onto the strands. Locations and harping of adjustable 
 strands can be further defined by vertical adjustment of the strand pattern.</p>

<p>Defining strands in PGSuper is a two step process: First; available 
 locations, possible types, and fill order for strands must be defined 
 by the strand grids in a girder's <a href="../Appendix B - PGSuper Library Dialogs/PsglibGirder_Template_Editing_Dialog.htm">Girder 
 Library</a> entry. Once defined, locations can be filled and adjusted 
 using the Girder Details dialog above.</p>

<h3>Basic Types of Strands</h3>

<p><!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->PGSuper 
 provides input for three basic types of strands:</p>

<ol style="list-style: decimal;"
	type=1>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Straight Permanent 
 Strands</span> can be placed anywhere within a girder section and are 
 straight along the entire girder. &quot;Permanent&quot; means that these 
 strands are jacked in the casting yard with the prestressing remaining 
 for the life of the girder.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Adjustable Strands</span> 
 are permanent strands that have the unique capability to be adjusted vertically 
 within a girder's web region. Adjustable strands can only be placed within 
 the thinnest portion of a girder section's web(s), and can optionally 
 be adjusted vertically continuously within the bounds defined by the girder 
 library entry. There are two possible types of Adjustable Strands: <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">Harped or</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Straight-web</span> 
 strands. Harped strands are draped at the girder's harping points, and 
 Straight web strands are straight along the entire length of the girder.<br>
	<br>
	Harping (draping) is created by vertical adjustment of the strand group 
 at the girder ends or harping points.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Temporary Strands are straight strands that can 
 be placed anywhere within a girder. Temporary strands can be pretensioned 
 or post-tensioned. Pretensioned strands are tensioned prior to casting. 
 Post-tensioned temporary strands can be applied to the girder either immediately 
 before lifting, immediately after lifting, or immediately before shipping. 
 All Temporary Strands are removed after shipping (before Bridge Site Stage 
 1). Temporary strands post-tensioned immediately before shipping are assumed 
 to have no impact on camber and losses.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Selection of Adjustable Strand Type</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, adjustable strands can be either harped or straight. 
 The possible selections for a given girder are defined in its girder library 
 entry.</p>

<h3>Filling of Prestressing Strands</h3>

<p>There are two basic methods for filling prestressing strand locations: 
 1) Enter a number strands - Strands are filled sequentially using the 
 order defined by the pertinent girder library entry. 2) Direct selection 
 of available strand locations using the &quot;Select Strands&quot; dialog. 
 This allows strands to be filled out of order.</p>

<h4>Entering Number of Strands (Sequential Strand Fill)</h4>

<p>For this method, Strands are filled sequentially using the permanent 
 strand fill order defined in the girder's library entry. Strand 1 goes 
 in position 1, strand 2 goes in position 2, and so on.</p>

<p>To enter the number of strands, simply use the Up/Down arrow buttons 
 on the dialog to dial-in the desired number of strands. The number of 
 strands is limited to the potential strand locations defined by the Girder 
 Library Entry. The number of strands may be specified as the Number of 
 Straight and Number of adjustable (Harped or Straight-web) or as the Total 
 Number of Strands. </p>

<h4>Direct Selection of Strand Locations</h4>

<p>This method allows filling of strands by selecting individual strand 
 locations in the &quot;<a href="../../Dialogs/Direct_Selection_of_Strand_Fill.htm">Select 
 Strands</a>&quot; dialog.</p>

<p class=Tip>Note: The automated design algorithm always fills strands 
 using sequential strand fill.</p>

<h3>Entering Jacking Forces</h3>

<p>You can explicitly enter a jacking force for each group (straight, adjustable, 
 or temporary) of prestressing strands, or you can let PGSuper compute 
 the maximum allowable jacking force based on LRFD 5.9.3. Explicitly entering 
 the jacking force is useful when evaluating a design or existing structure.</p>

<p>To explicitly enter the jacking force:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Remove the check from &quot;Calculate Jacking 
 Force&quot;</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Enter the jacking force</p></li>
</ol>

<p>To let PGSuper compute the maximum allowable jacking force</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Check the Calculate Jacking Force option.</p></li>
</ol>

<p CLASS=Tip><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span> : PGSuper will 
 use the average jacking stress for all strands in the section when performing 
 calculations.</p>

<h3>Vertical Location of Adjustable Strands (Harped or Straight-web)</h3>

<p>If allowed by the library entry; you can adjust the vertical location 
 of adjustable harped strands at the end of the girder and/or at the harping 
 point, or for adjustable straight-web strands along the girder. These 
 adjustments are typically made to control stresses. For example: In the 
 casting yard stage, if there is excessive compressive stress at the top 
 of the girder, near the ends, adjustable strands could be lowered to relieve 
 the stress. Likewise, if there is excessive compressive stress at the 
 bottom of the girder, between harping points, the harping points can be 
 raised to relieve the stress. The basis location of adjustable strands 
 can be described by:</p>

<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Distance between the CG of the Web Strand Force 
 and the Top of the Girder</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Distance between the CG of the Web Strand Force 
 and the Bottom of the Girder</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Distance between the Top-Most Web Strand and the 
 Top of the Girder</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Distance between the Top-Most Web Strand and the 
 Bottom of the Girder</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Distance between the Bottom-Most Web Strand and 
 the Bottom of the Girder</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Eccentricity of the Web Strand Group as measured 
 on the non-composite section</p></li>
</ul>

<p class=Tip><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: Adjustable strands 
 must lie within the vertical bounds defined by the adjustment bounds defined 
 in the girder library entry.</p>

<p class=Tip><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span><span> Hold the 
 CTRL key down while changing the basis of measurement and the input value 
 will be converted to the new basis.</span></p>

<h3>Prestressing Strand Type</h3>
