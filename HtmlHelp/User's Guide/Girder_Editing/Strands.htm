<h1>Strands</h1>

<p>On the Strands tab, describe the number and location of the prestressing 
 strands.</p>

<h2>Strand Details</h2>

<p>Prestressing is described by the number of harped (or straight-web), 
 straight, and temporary prestressing strands, and the jacking force imparted 
 onto the strands. Locations of harped (or straight-web) strands can be 
 further defined by vertical adjustment of the strand pattern at the end 
 of the girder or at the harping point.</p>

<p>Allowable locations for strands are defined in the <a href="../Appendix B - PGSuper Library Dialogs/PsglibGirder_Template_Editing_Dialog.htm">Girder 
 Library</a> for the pertinent girder library entry. PGSuper allows input 
 of three basic types of strands. </p>

<ol style="list-style: decimal;"
	type=1>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Straight Permanent 
 Strands</span> can be placed anywhere within a girder section and are 
 straight along the entire girder. &quot;Permanent&quot; means that these 
 strands are jacked in the casting yard with the prestressing remaining 
 for the life of the girder.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Web Strands</span> 
 are permanent strands that can only be placed within the thinnest portion 
 of a girder section's web(s). Web Strands have the unique capability to 
 be vertically adjusted within the web region. There are two types of Web 
 Strands: <span style="font-style: italic;">Harped Strands</span> and <span 
 style="font-style: italic;">Straight-Web</span> strands. Harped strands 
 are draped at the girders harping points, and Straight-Web strands are 
 straight along the entire length of the girder.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Temporary Strands are straight strands that can 
 be placed anywhere within a girder. The strands can be pretensioned in 
 the casting yard or posttensioned at various stages in the girder's life 
 and are removed after shipping.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Entering Number of Strands</h3>

<p>To enter the number of strands, simply use the Up/Down arrow buttons 
 to dial-in the desired number of strands. The number of strands are limited 
 to the number of potential strand locations defined for the Girder Library 
 Entry in use. The number of strands may be specified as the Number of 
 Straight and Number of Harped or Straight-Web (WSDOT method), or as the 
 Total Number of Strands (TxDOT method). </p>

<p>Strands are filled in the order prescribed by the permanent strand fill 
 order in the girder's library entry.</p>

<h3>Entering Jacking Force</h3>

<p>You can explicitly enter a jacking force for each group (straight, web, 
 temporary) of the prestressing strands, or you can let PGSuper compute 
 the maximum allowable jacking force based on LRFD 5.9.3. Explicitly entering 
 the jacking force is useful when evaluating a design or existing structure.</p>

<p>To explicitly enter the jacking force:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Remove the check from &quot;Calculate Jacking 
 Force&quot;</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Enter the jacking force</p></li>
</ol>

<p>To let PGSuper compute the maximum allowable jacking force</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Check the Calculate Jacking Force option.</p></li>
</ol>

<p CLASS=Tip><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span> : PGSuper will 
 use the average jacking stress for all strands in the section when performing 
 calculations.</p>

<h3>Temporary Strands</h3>

<p>Temporary strands can be pretensioned or post-tensioned. Pretensioned 
 strands are built into the girder and are effective during lifting and 
 shipping. Post-tensioned temporary strands can be applied to the girder 
 either immediately before lifting, immediately after lifting, or immediately 
 before shipping. Temporary strands are assumed to be removed after shipping. 
 Temporary strands post-tensioned immediately before shipping are assumed 
 to have no impact on camber and losses.</p>

<p>Use the drop down list to describe how temporary strands are used.</p>

<h3>Vertical Location of Web (Harped or Straight-Web) Strands</h3>

<p>If allowed by the library entry; you can adjust the vertical location 
 of harped strands at the end of the girder or at the harping point, or 
 straight-web strands along the girder to control stresses. For example: 
 In the casting yard stage, if there is excessive compressive stress at 
 the top of the girder, near the ends, the web strands could be lowered 
 to relieve the stress. Likewise, if there is excessive compressive stress 
 at the bottom of the girder, between harping points, the harping points 
 can be raised to relieve the stress. The basis location of the web strands 
 can be described by:</p>

<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Distance between the CG of the Web Strand Force 
 and the Top of the Girder</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Distance between the CG of the Web Strand Force 
 and the Bottom of the Girder</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Distance between the Top-Most Web Strand and the 
 Top of the Girder</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Distance between the Top-Most Web Strand and the 
 Bottom of the Girder</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Distance between the Bottom-Most Web Strand and 
 the Bottom of the Girder</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Eccentricity of the Web Strand Group as measured 
 on the non-composite section</p></li>
</ul>

<p class=Tip><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: Web strands 
 must lie within the vertical bounds defined by the adjustment bounds defined 
 in the girder library entry.</p>

<p class=Tip><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span><span> Hold the 
 CTRL key down while changing the basis of measurement and the input value 
 will be converted to the new basis.</span></p>

<h3>Prestressing Strand Type</h3>

<p>Define the material and size of the strand using the available options.</p>
