<h1>Strands</h1>

<p>On the Strands tab, describe the number and location of the prestressing 
 strands.</p>

<h2>Strand Details</h2>

<p>The prestressing is described by the number of harped, straight, and 
 temporary prestressing strands, and the jacking force imparted onto the 
 strands. Locations of harped strands can be further described by adjusting 
 the strand pattern at the end of the girder or at the harping point.</p>

<h3>Entering Number of Strands</h3>

<p>To enter the number of strands, simply use the Up/Down arrow buttons 
 to dial-in the desired number of strands. The number of strands are limited 
 to the number of potential strand locations defined for the Girder Library 
 Entry you are using. The number of strands may be specified as the Number 
 of Straight and Number of Harped (WSDOT method) or as the Total Number 
 of Strands (TxDOT method). </p>

<p>Strands are filled in the order prescribed by the permanent strand fill 
 order in the library entry.</p>

<h3>Entering Jacking Force</h3>

<p>You can explicitly enter a jacking force for each group (straight, harped, 
 temporary) of the prestressing strands, or you can let PGSuper compute 
 the maximum allowable jacking force based on LRFD 5.9.3. Explicitly entering 
 the jacking force is useful when evaluating a design or existing structure.</p>

<p>To explicitly enter the jacking force:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Remove the check from &quot;Calculate Jacking 
 Force&quot;</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Enter the jacking force</p></li>
</ol>

<p>To let PGSuper compute the maximum allowable jacking force</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Check the Calculate Jacking Force option.</p></li>
</ol>

<p CLASS=Tip><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span> : PGSuper will 
 use the average jacking stress for all strands in the section when performing 
 calculations.</p>

<h3>Temporary Strands</h3>

<p>Temporary strands can be pretensioned or post-tensioned. Pretensioned 
 strands are built into the girder and are effective during lifting and 
 shipping. Post-tensioned temporary strands can be applied to the girder 
 either immediately before lifting, immediately after lifting, or immediately 
 before shipping. Temporary strands are assumed to be removed after shipping. 
 Temporary strands post-tensioned immediately before shipping are assumed 
 to have no impact on camber and losses.</p>

<p>Use the drop down list to describe how temporary strands are used.</p>

<h3>Vertical Location of Harped Strands</h3>

<p>If allowed by the library entry, you can adjust the vertical location 
 of the harped strands at the end of the girder and at the harping point 
 to control stresses. For example: In the casting yard stage, if there 
 is excessive compressive stress at the top of the girder, near the ends, 
 the harped strands could be lowered to relieve the stress. Likewise, if 
 there is excessive compressive stress at the bottom of the girder, between 
 harping points, the harping points can be raised to relieve the stress. 
 The location of the harped strands can be described by:</p>

<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Distance between the CG of the Harped Strand Force 
 and the Top of the Girder</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Distance between the CG of the Harped Strand Force 
 and the Bottom of the Girder</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Distance between the Top-Most Harped Strand and 
 the Top of the Girder</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Distance between the Top-Most Harped Strand and 
 the Bottom of the Girder</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Distance between the Bottom-Most Harped Strand 
 and the Bottom of the Girder</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Eccentricity of the Harped Strand Group measured 
 on the non-composite section</p></li>
</ul>

<p class=Tip><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: Harped strands 
 must lie within the vertical bounds defined by the girder.</p>

<p class=Tip><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span><span> Hold the 
 CTRL key down while changing the basis of measurement and the input value 
 will be converted to the new basis.</span></p>
