<h1>Strands</h1>

<p>Use the Strands tab on the Girder Details dialog to describe the filling 
 of strands, jacking forces, type of strands, and vertical adjustment of 
 harped prestressing strand locations.</p>

<h2>Describing Prestressing Strands in a Girder</h2>

<p>Allowable locations for strands in a given girder are defined in the 
 strand grids in the <a href="../Appendix B - PGSuper Library Dialogs/PsglibGirder_Template_Editing_Dialog.htm">Girder 
 Library</a>.</p>

<p>Pretensioned prestressing is described by filling allowable locations 
 of straight, harped (or straight-web), and temporary prestressing strands, 
 and the jacking force imparted onto the strands. Locations of harped (or 
 straight-web) strands can be further defined by vertical adjustment of 
 the strand pattern at the end of the girder or at the harping point.</p>

<h3>Basic Types of Strands</h3>

<p><!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->PGSuper 
 provides input for three basic types of strands:</p>

<ol style="list-style: decimal;"
	type=1>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Straight Permanent 
 Strands</span> can be placed anywhere within a girder section and are 
 straight along the entire girder. &quot;Permanent&quot; means that these 
 strands are jacked in the casting yard with the prestressing remaining 
 for the life of the girder.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Web Strands</span> 
 are permanent strands that can only be placed within the thinnest portion 
 of a girder section's web(s). Web Strands have the unique capability to 
 be vertically adjusted within the web region. There are two possible types 
 of Web Strands: <span style="font-style: italic;">Harped Strands</span> 
 and <span style="font-style: italic;">Straight-Web</span> strands. Harped 
 strands are draped at the girders harping points, and Straight-Web strands 
 are straight along the entire length of the girder.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Temporary Strands are straight strands that can 
 be placed anywhere within a girder. Temporary strands can be pretensioned 
 or post-tensioned. Pretensioned strands are tensioned prior to casting. 
 Post-tensioned temporary strands can be applied to the girder either immediately 
 before lifting, immediately after lifting, or immediately before shipping. 
 All Temporary Strands are removed after shipping (before Bridge Site Stage 
 1). Temporary strands post-tensioned immediately before shipping are assumed 
 to have no impact on camber and losses.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Filling of Prestressing Strands</h3>

<p>There are two basic methods for filling prestressing strand locations: 
 1) Enter a number strands - Strands are filled sequentially using the 
 order defined by the pertinent girder library entry. 2) Direct selection 
 of available strand locations using the &quot;Select Strands&quot; dialog. 
 This allows strands to be filled out of order.</p>

<h4>Entering Number of Strands (Sequential Strand Fill)</h4>

<p>For this method, Strands are filled sequentially in the order defined 
 by the permanent strand fill order in the girder's library entry. Strand 
 1 goes in position 1, strand 2 goes in position 2, and so on.</p>

<p>To enter the number of strands, simply use the Up/Down arrow buttons 
 on the dialog to dial-in the desired number of strands. The number of 
 strands is limited to the potential strand locations defined by the Girder 
 Library Entry assigned to the girder in question. The number of strands 
 may be specified as the Number of Straight and Number of Harped (or Straight-Web) 
 or as the Total Number of Strands. </p>

<h4>Direct Selection of Strand Locations</h4>

<p>This method allows filling of strands by selecting individual strand 
 locations in the &quot;<a href="../../Dialogs/Direct_Selection_of_Strand_Fill.htm">Select 
 Strands</a>&quot; dialog. </p>

<p class=Tip>Note: The automated design algorithm always fills strands 
 using sequential strand fill.</p>

<h3>Entering Jacking Forces</h3>

<p>You can explicitly enter a jacking force for each group (straight, web, 
 or temporary) of prestressing strands, or you can let PGSuper compute 
 the maximum allowable jacking force based on LRFD 5.9.3. Explicitly entering 
 the jacking force is useful when evaluating a design or existing structure.</p>

<p>To explicitly enter the jacking force:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Remove the check from &quot;Calculate Jacking 
 Force&quot;</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Enter the jacking force</p></li>
</ol>

<p>To let PGSuper compute the maximum allowable jacking force</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Check the Calculate Jacking Force option.</p></li>
</ol>

<p CLASS=Tip><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span> : PGSuper will 
 use the average jacking stress for all strands in the section when performing 
 calculations.</p>

<h3>Vertical Location of Web (Harped or Straight-Web) Strands</h3>

<p>If allowed by the library entry; you can adjust the vertical location 
 of harped strands at the end of the girder or at the harping point, or 
 straight-web strands along the girder to control stresses. For example: 
 In the casting yard stage, if there is excessive compressive stress at 
 the top of the girder, near the ends, the web strands could be lowered 
 to relieve the stress. Likewise, if there is excessive compressive stress 
 at the bottom of the girder, between harping points, the harping points 
 can be raised to relieve the stress. The basis location of the web strands 
 can be described by:</p>

<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Distance between the CG of the Web Strand Force 
 and the Top of the Girder</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Distance between the CG of the Web Strand Force 
 and the Bottom of the Girder</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Distance between the Top-Most Web Strand and the 
 Top of the Girder</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Distance between the Top-Most Web Strand and the 
 Bottom of the Girder</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Distance between the Bottom-Most Web Strand and 
 the Bottom of the Girder</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Eccentricity of the Web Strand Group as measured 
 on the non-composite section</p></li>
</ul>

<p class=Tip><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: Web strands 
 must lie within the vertical bounds defined by the adjustment bounds defined 
 in the girder library entry.</p>

<p class=Tip><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span><span> Hold the 
 CTRL key down while changing the basis of measurement and the input value 
 will be converted to the new basis.</span></p>
