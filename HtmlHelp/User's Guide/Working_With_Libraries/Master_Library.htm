<h1>Master Library</h1>

<p>The Master Library is a file that contains entries for the different 
 PGSuper Libraries. This file is usually stored on a network to allow all 
 engineers within an organization to share it.</p>

<p>From a typical user's perspective, you should never need to edit the 
 Master Library. The entries in the Master Library appear in the <a HREF="Library_View.htm">Library 
 View</a> as entries that are permanently built into PGSuper. You can't 
 change these entries and you can't delete them from the PGSuper application. 
 In fact, the Master Library can only be edited using the Library Editor 
 application as described in the <a href="../../Adminstrator%27s Guide/Introduction_Admin_Guide.htm">PGSuper 
 Administrator's Guide</a>. For networked environments, the Master Library 
 should be managed by the PGSuper Administrator. </p>

<p>Depending on your needs, you might want to have more than one Master 
 Library file. One reason for having multiple Master Library files is managing 
 the &quot;default&quot; behavior of PGSuper for different clients. For 
 example, if you are a consultant, your organization may have a Master 
 Library file for each agency that you work with. You can easily switch 
 the library file depending on which client you are working for. You can 
 change the Master Library file location using the procedures outlined 
 in the <a HREF="../../Adminstrator%27s Guide/Introduction_Admin_Guide.htm">Administrator's 
 Guide</a>.</p>
