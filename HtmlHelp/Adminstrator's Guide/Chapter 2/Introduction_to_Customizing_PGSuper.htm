<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>A lot of detailed information is required in order for PGSuper to model 
 real bridge structures and to perform thorough specification compliance 
 checking. The Master Library allows you to create a centralized storehouse 
 for common PGSuper information that can be shared in your workgroup. In 
 this chapter you will learn how to manage the PGSuper Master Library.</p>

<p>The PGSuper library greatly simplifies user input. In the various libraries, 
 standard information is recorded in a library entry and given a common 
 name. When describing the bridge, you simply refer to a library entry 
 by name. For example, to describe a girder in PGSuper you need to supply 
 the dimensions of the cross section, the layout of the prestressing strands, 
 the location of the harping points, the stirrup configuration, and other 
 details. The detailed data for a particular girder entry is given a common 
 name like &quot;WF74G&quot;. To use this girder in a bridge model, simply 
 refer to the name &quot;WF74G&quot;. This is a lot easier than entering 
 all the parameters, especially if the parameters don't change from project 
 to project. A &quot;WF74G&quot; girder can be defined once and used over 
 and over again.</p>

<p>The PGSuper Library is comprised of two different types of entries: 
 Master Library Entries and Project Library Entries. As you might guess, 
 Master Library Entries are stored in the Master Library. The Master Library 
 is typically stored on a network and all the engineers within an organization 
 can share it. This makes it easy for an entire team of bridge designers 
 to work with the same information. The Master Library can only be edited 
 using the Library Editor application as described in the <a HREF="../Chapter 4/Chapter_4.htm">Library 
 Editor User's Manual</a></p>

<p>However, we also recognize that unique projects do come up, and it is 
 desirable to be able to change library data in your local project and 
 not have to deal with sharing and administrating the data. Hence the need 
 for Project Library Entries, which are stored end edited locally in your 
 project file using the PGSuper application.</p>
