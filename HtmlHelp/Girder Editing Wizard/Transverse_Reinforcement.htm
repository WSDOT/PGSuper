<h1>Girder Description - Transverse Reinforcement</h1>

<p>This tab of the Girder Editor defines transverse reinforcement..</p>

<h2>Mild Steel Material</h2>

<p>Select the appropriate mild steel for the transverse rebar</p>

<h2>Transverse Reinforcement Zones</h2>

<p>The transverse reinforcement is described by zones, beginning at the 
 left end of the girder. PGSuper assumes that transverse reinforcement 
 is symmetrical about the center of the girder. Transverse reinforcement 
 zones are described by their length, spacing and bar size. </p>

<p>This reinforcement can, at your option, be assumed to engage the deck 
 and is adequately developed. If it is assumed to engage the deck, its 
 contribution to the horizontal interface shear resistance will be accounted 
 for.</p>

<p>Use the Insert Row and Delete Row buttons to add and remove rows from 
 the grid.</p>

<p>Transverse reinforcement can be vertical, horizontal, or both. The vertical 
 reinforcement is always considered when evaluating the vertical shear 
 capacity of a girder. Either the vertical or horizontal reinforcement 
 is considered when evaluating splitting resistance in the pretensioned 
 anchorage zone (LRFD 5.10.10.1). The vertical reinforcement is used for 
 I-girders, bulb tee girders, and stemmed girders (double tee, ribbed girders, 
 etc). The horizontal reinforcement is used for solid or voided slabs. 
 For pretensioned box or tub girders the horizontal reinforcement will 
 be used if the girder is taller than it is wide and the vertical reinforcement 
 will be used if the girder is wider than it is tall.</p>

<h2>Top Flange Horizontal Interface Shear Steel</h2>

<p>The top flange horizontal interface shear steel are stirrups located 
 in the top flange of the section only which protrude up into the slab. 
 They are used to add strength to the slab-girder interface to resist horizontal 
 shear forces. These stirrups are spaced evenly along the entire length 
 of the girder. Each stirrup provides two legs of reinforcement.</p>

<h2>Bottom Flange Confinement Steel</h2>

<p>Confinement reinforcement must be described in order to evaluate LRFD 
 5.10.10.2 . Confinement reinforcement is described by the bar size, and 
 by its ending location. It is assumed that confinement steel begins in 
 Zone 1 and is included in every zone up to and including the last zone 
 specified.</p>

<h2>Restoring Library Defaults</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">By pressing the Restore to Library 
 Defaults button, the transverse reinforcement zones and bottom flange 
 confinement steel values are set equal to those defined in the PGSuper 
 library.</span><span style="margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</span><span 
 style="margin-bottom: 0;"> All current data is overridden.</span></p>
