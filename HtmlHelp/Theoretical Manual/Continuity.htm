<h1>Bridges Composed of Simple Spans Made Continuous</h1>

<p>PGSuper offers three methods of structural analysis for precast prestressed 
 girder brides composed of simple spans made continuous. Bridges may be 
 designed as a series of simple spans, simple spans made continuous, or 
 for the envelope of these two conditions.</p>

<p>Guidance and requirements for the design of continuous bridges is given 
 in LRFD 5.14.1.4</p>

<h2>Simple Spans and Envelope Analysis</h2>

<p>When the Simple Span and Envelope analysis option is used, the requirements 
 of LRFD 5.14.1.4 are not required to be satisfied (see LRFD 5.14.1.4.1)</p>

<h2>Simple Spans Made Continuous</h2>

<p>When the Simple Spans Made Continuous analysis option is used, the requirements 
 of LRFD 5.14.1.4 are required to be satisfied. </p>

<h4>5.14.1.4.2 Restraint Moments</h4>

<p>PGSuper does not compute restrain moments. Restraint moments can be 
 computed by any method deemed appropriate by the engineer and modeled 
 in PGSuper with user defined concentrated moments. (See <a HREF="../User%27s Guide/UserDefinedLoads/Introduction.htm">Chapter 
 5</a> of the PGSuper User's Guide for details)</p>

<h4>5.14.1.4.4 Age of Girder When Continuity is Established</h4>

<p>PGSuper does not make any assumptions about the age of the girder when 
 continuity is established.</p>

<h4>5.14.1.4.5 Degree of Continuity at Various Limit States</h4>

<p>For bridges with fully effective connections continuity can be accounted 
 for in the Strength and Service Limit States. For partially effective 
 connection, continuity can only be accounted for in the Strength Limit 
 State.</p>

<p>PGSuper will consider a connection as fully effect if the calculated 
 stress at the bottom of the continuity diaphragm for the combination of 
 superimposed permanent loads, creep, shrinkage, and 50 percent live load 
 is compressive. This is consistent with the first bullet paragraph in 
 LRFD 5.14.1.4.5.</p>

<h4>5.14.1.4.6 Service Limit State</h4>

<p>PGSuper assumes that the top of the precast girders at interior supports 
 are designed as reinforced concrete members at the strength limit state. 
 In this case, the stress limits for the service limit state do not apply 
 to the top of the girders near interior supports.</p>

<h4>5.14.1.4.7 Strength Limit State</h4>

<p>PGSuper evaluates the negative moment capacity at interior supports</p>

<h4>5.14.1.4.8-10</h4>

<p>PGSuper does not consider this provisions.</p>
