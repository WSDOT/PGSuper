<h1>Lightweight Concrete</h1>

<p>Lightweight concrete was added to PGSuper Version 2.4. The features 
 are compatible back to LRFD 1st Edition 1994. Lightweight concrete is 
 defined by LRFD 5.2 as <span style="font-style: italic;">concrete containing 
 lightweight aggregate and having and air-dry unit weight not exceeding 
 0.120 kcf.</span> </p>

<p>Input of a unit weight is not enough to fully define lightweight concrete. 
 Lightweight concrete can be classified as <span style="font-style: italic;">all 
 lightweight</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">sand lightweight</span>. 
 All-lightweight concrete contains lightweight sand and course aggregate. 
 Sand lightweight contains normal weight sand and lightweight course aggregate.</p>

<p>AASHTO defines normal weight concrete as having a unit weight between 
 0.135 and 0.155 kcf. This leaves unclassified types with unit weights 
 between 0.120 and 0.135 kcf and greater than 0.155 kcf. PGSuper permits 
 concrete definitions to use any unit weight. You decide how PGSuper will 
 treat your concrete definitions by classifying the concrete as Normal 
 Weight, Sand Lightweight, and All Lightweight. PGSuper will select the 
 applicable equations from the AASHTO LRFD based on your concrete classification.</p>

<p>The material properties of lightweight concrete vary greatly with the 
 aggregate source and mix design. Modulus of elasticity, creep, and shrinkage 
 are significant material properties that generally need to account for 
 aggregate source. Concrete material definitions include aggregate correction 
 factors for averaging and bounding. See <a HREF="Concrete_Material_Properties.htm">Concrete 
 Material Properties</a> for more information.</p>
