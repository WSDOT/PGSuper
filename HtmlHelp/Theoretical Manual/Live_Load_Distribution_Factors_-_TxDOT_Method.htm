<h1>Live Load Distribution Factors - TxDOT Method</h1>

<p>TxDOT deviates from the AASHTO LRFD Specifications for several girder 
 types. The paragraphs below contain excerpts from the TxDOT LRFD Bridge 
 Specifications, Revised April, 2007:</p>

<h3>Section 3.5: Precast Concrete I Beams </h3>

<p>Live load distribution factors must conform to AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design 
 Specifications, Article 4.6.2.2.2 for flexural moment and Article 4.6.2.2.3 
 for shear, except as noted below:</p>

<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>For exterior beam design with a slab cantilever 
 length equal to or less than one-half of the adjacent interior beam spacing, 
 use the live load distribution factor for the interior beam. The slab 
 cantilever length is defined as the distance from the center line of the 
 exterior beam to the edge of the slab. </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>For exterior beam design with a slab cantilever 
 length exceeding one-half of the adjacent interior beam spacing, use the 
 lever rule with the multiple presence factor of 1.0 for single lane to 
 determine the live load distribution. The live load used to design the 
 exterior beam must never be less than the live load used to design an 
 interior beam.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Do not use the special analysis based on conventional 
 approximation for loads on piles per AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications, 
 Article C4.6.2.2.2d, unless the effectiveness of diaphragms on the lateral 
 distribution of truck loads is investigated.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Section 3.6: Prestressed Concrete U Beams (Types U40 and U54)</h3>

<p>Live load distribution factors must conform to AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design 
 Specifications, Article 4.6.2.2.2 for flexural moment and Article 4.6.2.2.3 
 for shear, except for exterior beam design. For exterior beam design, 
 use a distribution factor for two or more design lanes loaded only. Do 
 not use the distribution factor for one design lane loaded unless the 
 clear roadway width is less than 20.0 ft. Use 1.0 for the multiple presence 
 factor for one lane loaded. For exterior beams, multiply the result of 
 the lever rule by 0.9 to account for continuity. The live load used to 
 design the exterior beam must never be less than the live load used to 
 design an interior beam.</p>

<p>For bridges with less than three girders in the cross section, assume 
 the live load distribution factors for flexural moment and shear are equal 
 to the number of lanes divided by the number of girders. Determine the 
 number of lanes as required by AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications, 
 Article 3.6.1.1.1.</p>

<h3>Section 3.7: Prestressed Concrete Slab Beams</h3>

<p>Live load distribution factors for all beams, both moment and shear, 
 must conform to AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications. Table 4.6.2.2.2b-1, 
 using cross section (g), if the beams are connected only enough to prevent 
 relative vertical displacement at their interfaces. This is called S/D 
 distribution.</p>

<p>Do not apply the skew correction factors for moment as suggested in 
 Article 4.6.2.2.2e nor for shear as suggested in Article 4.6.2.2.3c.</p>

<h3>Section 3.8: Prestressed Concrete Double-Tee Beams</h3>

<p>Regardless of topping, live load distribution factors for all beams--both 
 moment and shear--must conform to AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications, 
 Table 4.6.2.2.2b-1, using cross section (i) if beams are connected only 
 enough to prevent relative vertical displacement at their interfaces. 
 Use K = 2.2 when determining the live load distribution factor. Use S/10 
 as maximum limit on live load distribution.</p>

<h3>Section 3.9: Prestressed Concrete Box Beams (Types B20, B28, B34, and 
 B40 )</h3>

<p>Live load distribution factors must conform to AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design 
 Specifications, Article 4.6.2.2.2 and Article 4.6.2.2.3. Use:</p>

<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Cross section (f) with bridges having a composite 
 concrete slab</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Cross section (g) with bridges having ACP applied 
 directly to tops of beams, assuming beams are sufficiently connected to 
 act as a unit.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>Do not apply the skew correction factor for moment 
 as suggested in Article 4.6.2.2.2e.</p></li>
</ul>
