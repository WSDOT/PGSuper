<h1>Shear Capacity Analysis</h1>

<p>One of the features that distinguish the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications 
 from the Standard Specifications is the introduction of the Modified Compression 
 Field Theory (MCFT) for the prediction of ultimate shear capacity. The 
 shear capacity provisions of the LRFD specifications have changed many 
 times over the years. Changes have been made to simplify the application 
 of the MCFT method and provide alternatives that more closely resembled 
 the Standard Specifications.</p>

<p>WSDOT has issued three design memorandums relating to shear capacity 
 analysis, establishing office policy that deviates slightly from what 
 is described in the AASHTO LRFD. Listed below are the design memorandums. 
 Each describes a method of computing</p>

<p><a HREF="Shear_Design_Memo_June_2001.htm">June 2001 Design Memorandum</a><br>
Simplified computation of longitudinal strain by letting 0.5cot<span style="font-family: Symbol, serif;">q</span> 
 = 1.0.</p>

<p><a HREF="Shear_Design_Memo_April_2007.htm">April 2007 Design Memorandum</a><br>
Directs engineers to follow the June 2001 design memorandum and not apply 
 the provisions of LRFD 5.8.3.4.3 (Vci - Vcw method)</p>

<p><a HREF="Shear_Design_Memo_August_2007.htm">August 2007 Design Memorandum</a>: 
 <br>
Supercedes June 2001 design memorandum and directs engineers to use, what 
 will be known as the &quot;General Procedure&quot; when published in the 
 2008 interim provisions.</p>

<h2>Shear Capacity for Load Rating Analysis</h2>

<p>One of the unique features of the MCFT is that ultimate shear capacity 
 is a function of loading. Even though load ratings are computed for individual 
 vehicles the shear capacity is computed based on the live load envelope 
 of which the vehicle belongs. For example, the shear rating for the legal 
 load rating for routine commercial traffic may be controlled by the Type 
 3-3 vehicle, the shear capacity will be based on the envelope of all the 
 AASHTO Legal Load vehicles. In most all cases, the vehicle causing the 
 maximum shear in the live load envelope will be the same vehicle governing 
 the load rating.</p>
