<p>Hauling from the casting yard to the bridge site is a critical stage 
 in the life of a prestressed girder. Dynamic load effects and support 
 locations can create stress conditions that control overall girder design. 
 The Kansas DOT utilizes their own unique approach to the hauling analysis. 
 Section 3.5.2.13 of the KDOT Bridge Design Manual describes the method 
 as follows:</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"
	align=center>During transportation, prestressed beams may be subjected 
 to dynamic forces. This “bouncing” of the beam can reduce the dead load 
 on the member which could result in critical tension stresses in the top 
 of the beam. The designer should check these stresses by assuming support 
 points for beam transportation at 5.0 ft. from the end of the beam or 
 to the first tenth point of the span, whichever is greater. If the controlling 
 support distance is somewhere between 5 ft. and the first tenth point, 
 be sure to enter this maximum support length on the beam “Details Sheet”. 
 Verify that the maximum support length dimension is shown on the shop 
 drawings. Check tension in the top of the beam over the temporary support 
 due to the cantilevered moment. To approximate the dynamic load effects, 
 assume a beam dead load of “3g” on the cantilevered portion (PCI Design 
 Handbook, 1985, p. 5-17). </p>

<p style="text-align: center;"
	align=center><span style="font-style: italic;">Also check the tension 
 in the top of the beam at the harp point of the strands using the reduced 
 span length due to the temporary supports. Again, use “3g” for the overhang 
 force, but use the normal beam dead load (“g”) when computing forces between 
 the supports. Allow a maximum temporary tension stress of 0.24&#8730;f'</span><span 
 style="font-style: italic; vertical-align: Sub;">cavg</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> 
 ksi or 7.5 &#8730;f'</span><span style="font-style: italic; vertical-align: Sub;">cavg</span><span 
 style="font-style: italic;"> psi. This upper limit is allowed only if 
 the stresses in the mild reinforcement at the top of the member meet the 
 requirements of the commentary for Article C5.9.4.1.2.</span> </p>

<p>The figure below shows the basic analysis model and loading condition:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"
	align=center><img src="KdotHauling.gif"
						x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
						style="border: none;
								width: 421px;
								height: 226px;
								float: none;"
						width=421
						height=226
						border=0></p>

<p>Stresses along the top and bottom of the girder are checked at all locations 
 normally reported in PGSuper. This includes: 1/10th points, support locations, 
 hold down locations, section changes, prestress development lengths, bar 
 development length and debonding termination/development locations. A 
 global specification check failure will occur if any stresses are beyond 
 allowable limits.</p>

<p>Note: In the KDOT Bridge Design Manual example, girder stresses due 
 to prestress are computed using approximate prestress forces near the 
 girder ends, and assuming zero effects due to losses along the girder. 
 However, in PGSuper girder stresses due to prestress will to be computed 
 as they are in all other parts of the program: using loss-adjusted strand 
 forces, and actual girder section properties and strand locations at the 
 section in question.</p>

<h2>Design Algorithm</h2>

<p>During automated design the algorithm will attempt to determine the 
 largest allowable overhang based on the current concrete strength determined 
 by other force criteria. A basic flowchart of the process is shown below. 
 </p>

<p style="text-align: center;"
	align=center><img src="KdotHaulingAlgorithm.gif"
						x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
						style="border: none;
								width: 574px;
								height: 704px;
								float: none;"
						width=574
						height=704
						border=0></p>

<p>For the KDOT method, a design for hauling failure will not cause the 
 entire girder design to fail, and it will not change parameters and restart 
 the flexural design. In case of a hauling design failure, a warning note 
 will be presented in the Design Outcome dialog stating that the designer 
 was unable to find a sufficient hauling location. At this point users 
 must find an adequate hauling design manually.</p>
