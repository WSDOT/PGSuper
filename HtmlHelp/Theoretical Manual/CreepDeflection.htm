<h2>Deflections Due To Creep</h2>

<p>Deflections due to creep are computed in accordance with Article 5.4.2.3 
 of the LRFD Specification. The deflection due to creep is taken as <img 
 src="CreepEqn.gif"
	style="width: 186px;
			height: 29px;
			margin-top: 0px;
			margin-bottom: 0px;
			margin-left: 0px;
			margin-right: 0px;
			border-style: none;
			border-style: none;"
	width=186
	height=29
	border=0></p>

<p CLASS=MsoNormal>If the concrete is cured by steam or radiant heat, day 
 of accelerated curing will be taken equal to seven days of normal curing. 
 </p>

<p>In PGSuper, creep is computed in two stages in order to facilitate the 
 camber equations. The first stage of creep is computed during the time 
 from release of the prestressing strands until the time when the temporary 
 strands are cut and the diaphragms are cast. The second creep stage is 
 computed from the end of the first stage until the section is made composite.<span

<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Deviations from AASHTO LRFD 4th Edition, 
 2007</h2>

<p>The AASHTO LRFD 4th Edition, published in 2007, made changes to the 
 computation of the creep coefficient in Article 5.4.2.3.2 that are believed 
 to be editorial errors. These changes are ignored in PGSuper. In effect, 
 PGSuper uses the equations from Article 5.4.2.3.2 of the AASHTO LRFD 3rd 
 Edition with 2006 interim provisions.</p>

<p>The changes to the 4th Edition that are ignored by PGSuper are as follows:</p>

<ul style="list-style: disc;"
	type=disc>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>The notation for the volume to surface ratio effect 
 was changed from k<span style="vertical-align: Sub;">vs</span> to k<span 
 style="vertical-align: Sub;">s</span>. The notation k<span style="vertical-align: Sub;">s</span> 
 conflicts with k<span style="vertical-align: Sub;">s</span> used in equation 
 C5.4.2.3.2-2. Furthermore, the k<span style="vertical-align: Sub;">vs</span> 
 notation is inconsistently used at the end of the last paragraph in Article 
 5.4.2.3.2. PGSuper will use the k<span style="vertical-align: Sub;">vs</span> 
 notation.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>The lower limit of the volume to surface ratio 
 effect was changed from 0.0 to 1.0 in equation 5.4.2.3.2-2 [k<span style="vertical-align: Sub;">vs</span> 
 = 1.45-0.13(V/S) &gt;= 1.0]. The lower limit should be 0.0 as it was in 
 AASHTO LRFD 3rd Edition, 2006. In fact, this value was changed from 1.0 
 in AASHTO LRFD 3rd Edition, 2005 to 1.0 in 2006 to correct the error. 
 It is believed that the proposed changes to the 2007 AASHTO were based 
 on the language published in the 2005 AASHTO, thus the change to the lower 
 limit was mistakenly interpreted as a new change. PGSuper will use a lower 
 limit of 0.0.</p></li>
