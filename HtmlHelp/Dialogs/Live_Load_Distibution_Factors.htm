<h1>Live Load Distribution Factors</h1>

<p>This project-specific dialog allows you to chose whether live load distribution 
 factors are to be computed using the method specified in the current <a 
 href="../User%27s Guide/Appendix B - PGSuper Library Dialogs/PsglibSpecification_Entry_Dialog.htm">Project 
 Criteria library entry</a>, input manually, or computed using only the 
 lever rule. Options are also available to override safeguards when parameters 
 lie outside of the ranges of applicability specified in the AASHTO LRFD.</p>

<h2>Compute Live Load Distribution Factors in Accordance With the Currently 
 Selected Project Criteria</h2>

<p>When this option is selected, distribution factors are computed using 
 the methods specified on the <a href="../User%27s Guide/Appendix B - PGSuper Library Dialogs/PsglibBridge_Site_Tab.htm">Bridge 
 Site 3</a> tab of the currently selected Project Criteria Library entry. 
 The Ranges Of Applicability (ROA) for use of the distribution factor equations, 
 are girder-type dependent and defined in section 4.6.2.2 of the LRFD Specifications. 
 By default, PGSuper will refuse to analyze a structure where any range 
 of applicability rule is broken. However, there may be cases when you 
 want to override this behavior, and options are given below:</p>

<h3>When a Parameter is Outside of the ROA:</h3>

<h4>Halt the Analysis And Issue a Warning</h4>

<p>This is the default behavior. PGSuper will not complete the analysis 
 unless you override this.</p>

<h4>Ignore the ROA Requirements and Perform the Analysis Using the Equations</h4>

<p>The LRFD equations will be used for computation of distribution factors 
 regardless of their applicability.</p>

<p class=Tip>Note: Ignoring the range of applicability is generally NOT 
 RECOMMENDED, and should only be selected for special structures where 
 you need to control the computation of distribution factors. Checks using 
 hand calculations, or other methods, should always be done to insure that 
 the factors are computed as you intended.</p>

<h4>Use the Lever Rule Only for Cases Outside of the ROA Requirements</h4>

<p>The LRFD equations will be used for computation of distribution factors 
 where parameters are inside of the Range of Applicability. However, the 
 lever rule will be used for cases outside the ROA for the equation. This 
 option may seem safer than the previous option, however, the same amount 
 of caution should be applied when using it.</p>

<h2>Compute All Live Load Distribution Factors Using the Lever Rule</h2>

<p>When this option is selected, all distribution factors are computed 
 using the Lever Rule. Note that the LRFD skew factor equations are still 
 applied, however, any ROA requirements for the skew equations are ignored. 
 Again, use caution when using this option.</p>

<h2>Directly Input All Live Load Distribution Factors</h2>

<p>When this option is selected, user-input distribution factors are used 
 directly.</p>

<p CLASS=Tip>Tip: Use this dialog to enter your own live load distribution 
 factors if you don't like the values PGSuper calculates.</p>
