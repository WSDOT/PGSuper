<h1>Library Entry Conflict</h1>

<p>When reading your project file, PGSuper found that the project file 
 contains a library entry that has the same name as an entry in the Master 
 Library, but has different data values. Before PGSuper can proceed, this 
 conflict must be resolved.</p>

<p>Before discussing conflict resolution options, let's take a few moments 
 to understand what a Library Entry Conflict is. When you load a project, 
 PGSuper uses two different types of library entries: Project Library Entries 
 that are unique to the current project file, and Master Library Entries 
 that are defined in the Master Library File.</p>

<p>However, for safety reasons, every library entry used in a PGSuper Project 
 is copied into the project file. This way, if you send your file to a 
 colleague on the other side of the world who doesn't have a copy of your 
 Master Library, they can still use your project. But what happens if your 
 colleague has an entry in his Master Library that has the same name as, 
 but different data values than, one of the entries in your project's library? 
 Or, in a more common scenario, what happens if the data values of the 
 entries in your PGSuper Master Library have changed?</p>

<p>We leave it up to you, the user, to resolve the conflict. At this point 
 you have two options:</p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rename Entry</span></h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Press this button to rename the entry 
 in the project that is in conflict. All references to this library entry 
 will be updated to refer to the renamed entry. By selection this option, 
 all data remained unchanged (except for the entry's name)</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Overwrite</span></h3>

<p>Press this button to overwrite the library entry in your project file 
 with the one from the Master Library. This updates your project file to 
 match the data in the Master Library.</p>

<h2>Remarks</h2>

<p>There are several situations where you will encounter a Library Entry 
 Conflict. Two typical scenarios are described below.</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>You are currently working on a precast girder 
 design. The last time you worked with your PGSuper project, everything 
 was fine. This time, you open the project and you get a Library Entry 
 Conflict. For some reason your PGSuper Administrator has updated the Master 
 Library (maybe your office practice changed or there was an error in the 
 library data). You will probably want to ask the Administrator why the 
 entry has changed. If you want to use the latest data from the Master 
 Library, press the Overwrite button. If you want to keep your PGSuper 
 project the way it was the last time you were working on it, press the 
 Rename Entry button.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>You retrieve a PGSuper project file from a backup 
 tape. The project file is several years old. When you open the project 
 file you get a Library Entry Conflict. Depending on your reason for revisiting 
 this old project, you may or may not what to update the data. If you want 
 to analyze the data as it was when the project was archived, press the 
 Rename Entry button. If you are using the old project as a template for 
 a new project, you might want to press the Overwrite button to update 
 the old library entries so they match the current Master Library.</p></li>
</ul>
