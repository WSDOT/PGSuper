<h1>Preliminary Designer Attempt Complete</h1>

<p>After the PGSuper Preliminary Girder Designer has completed its design 
 attempt, you are presented with the Preliminary Design Complete dialog. 
 From here, you can view the outcome of the design attempt and choose whether 
 you will accept the design PGSuper has come up with.</p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Design Outcome Report</span></h2>

<p>The report in this dialog tells you the outcome of the design by the 
 Preliminary Girder Designer. There are two possible primary outcomes to 
 a design attempt: The designer was able to find a design that satisfied 
 its requirements or, it was not.</p>

<p><span style="font-style: normal;">If the designer was successful, this 
 means that the Designer succeeded in its objective. It doesn't mean that 
 you are finished with the design of the girder. You must next run a comprehensive 
 check to insure that the girder satisfies all specification provisions, 
 and is optimized based on your own design criteria (minimum weight, cost, 
 etc...). It is very likely that all criteria will not pass. The Details 
 Report and Specification Check Report contain comprehensive check information.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style: normal;">If the designer was not successful, 
 this means that the design algorithm failed to find a design to meet its 
 objectives. This does not necessarily mean that the current girder cannot 
 be made to pass all checks. However, it does mean that you will have to 
 manually change the design parameters in order to create a design that 
 passes all provisions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style: normal;">It is also possible that the girder 
 shape that you have selected simply cannot reach the span for your structure. 
 In this case, you will need to consider changing the span length, adjusting 
 the girder spacing, or selecting a larger girder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style: normal;">Refer to <a HREF="..\User's Guide\Design\Chapter_5.htm">Chapter 
 5</a> in the PGSuper User's Manual for more information.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update the Current Girder Parameters 
 with the Proposed Design?</span></h2>

<p>After reviewing the design attempt, select &quot;Reject the Design&quot; 
 if you want to keep the original (current) girder parameters, or &quot;Accept 
 the Design&quot; to update the girder with PGSuper's design. </p>

<p CLASS=Tip><span style="font-weight: normal;">Note that even if the designer 
 was unsuccessful, it will leave its last guess as an option to update 
 the design parameters. You may want to use this as a starting point for 
 your manual changes.</span><span style="margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</span><span 
 style="margin-bottom: 0;"> </span></p>
