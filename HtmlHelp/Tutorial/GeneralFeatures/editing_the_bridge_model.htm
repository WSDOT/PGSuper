<h1>Editing the Bridge Model</h1>

<p>The bridge modeled in the W58G template isn't exactly what we need. 
 In the next few sections you will learn how to setup the roadway alignment 
 and profile, locate the bridge piers, and establish the framing plan for 
 the bridge girders.</p>

<h2>Roadway Alignment and Profile</h2>

<p>No matter how you slice it, highway bridges are part of the road. Since 
 PGSuper is based on the assumption that you are working with a real bridge, 
 there must be a real roadway that influences the geometry of the structure. 
 We start describing our project by entering information about the roadway 
 alignment.</p>

<h6>Describing the Alignment</h6>

<p>1. Select <span style="font-weight: bold;">Edit | Alignment...</span>. 
 This will bring up the Alignment Description Dialog.</p>

<p>2. Select the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Horizontal</span> tab. 
 Enter the information shown below. If the alignment had horizontal curves, 
 they would be described in this dialog.</p>

<p><img src="Alignment.bmp"
		x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
		style="float: none;
				width: 439px;
				height: 423px;
				border-style: none;
				border-style: none;"
		width=439
		height=423
		border=0></p>

<p>A horizontal control point can be input for coordinate geometry calculations. 
 The default values are sufficient for this example.</p>

<p>3. Select the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Profile</span> tab. Enter 
 the information shown below. If this project had vertical curves, they 
 would be entered on this tab.</p>

<p><img src="Profile.bmp"
		x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
		style="border: none;
				width: 439px;
				height: 402px;
				float: none;
				border-style: none;
				border-style: none;"
		width=439
		height=402
		border=0></p>

<p>4. Select the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Superelevations</span> 
 tab. Enter the information shown.</p>

<p><img src="Superelevation.bmp"
		x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
		style="border: none;
				width: 439px;
				height: 402px;
				float: none;
				border-style: none;
				border-style: none;"
		width=439
		height=402
		border=0></p>

<p class=Tip>NOTE: The bridge geometry is parametrically linked to the 
 roadway alignment. The bridge geometry will automatically update if the 
 alignment changes.</p>

<h2>Bridge Framing</h2>

<p>Now that the roadway geometry is defined, we will define the bridge 
 beginning with the piers and abutments. The piers and abutments are where 
 the bridge geometry intersects the roadway geometry. The locations of 
 the piers establish the location of the bridge along the alignment.</p>

<h6>Defining the Bridge</h6>

<p>1. Select <span style="font-weight: bold;">Edit | Bridge...</span>. 
 This will bring up the Bridge Description Dialog.</p>

<p>The general bridge information is described on the General tab. Since 
 our bridge has a very simple configuration, most of the details of the 
 framing can be described on this tab.</p>

<p>The project template gets us very close with the bridge configuration. 
 The only change that needs to be made is to set the number of girder lines 
 to 6.</p>

<p><img src="General.bmp"
		x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
		style="border: none;
				float: none;
				border-style: none;
				width: 685px;
				height: 527px;
				border-style: none;"
		width=685
		height=527
		border=0></p>

<p class=Tip>NOTE: More complex bridges can be modeled in PGSuper. Different 
 girder cross sections, within the same general type of girder can be assigned 
 to each girder line. The number of girder lines can differ between spans. 
 The girder spacing can also differ between spans and within a span.</p>

<p>2) Select the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Framing</span> tab of 
 the Bridge Description dialog. </p>

<p>This is were the piers are located and oriented. Enter the information 
 shown below by either entering it directly into the grid or by pressing 
 the <span style="font-style: italic;">Edit Abutment Details</span><span> 
 buttons</span>.</p>

<p><img src="Piers.bmp"
		x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
		style="float: none;
				width: 685px;
				height: 527px;
				border-style: none;
				border-style: none;"
		width=685
		height=527
		border=0></p>

<p>3) We will use the default Railing System defined in the W58G template. 
 However, if we needed to use a different railing or traffic barrier, define 
 a sidewalk, or add an interior pedestrian barrier, this could be done 
 on the Railing System tab.</p>

<p>4) Select the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Deck Geometry and Materials 
 </span>tab of the Bridge Description Dialog. This is were we will describe 
 the bridge deck.</p>

<p>The cross section, material, and wearing surface input are self-explanatory. 
 The <span style="font-style: italic;">Plan (Edge of Deck)</span> input 
 needs a bit more explanation. In PGSuper, the deck width is described 
 by the distance from the Alignment or the Centerline of Bridge to the 
 left and right edges. For constant width decks with edges that parallel 
 the alignment, the left and right deck edge offset only needs to be defined 
 at one location. For our bridge, enter the edge of deck input shown below.</p>

<p><img src="Superstructure.bmp"
		x-maintain-ratio=TRUE
		style="border: none;
				float: none;
				width: 685px;
				height: 527px;
				border-style: none;
				border-style: none;"
		width=685
		height=527
		border=0></p>

<p class=Tip>NOTE: Bridge decks with complex geometry can be easily described 
 in PGSuper. By entering the deck edge offset at various stations and the 
 transitions between these offsets, many different types of deck geometry 
 can be modeled. The deck edge can be transitions between the edge points 
 with a Parallel transition (deck edge is parallel to alignment between 
 points), linear, or a spline curve.</p>

<p>This completes the description of the bridge.</p>

<p>Press the <span style="font-weight: bold;">OK</span> button. Notice 
 that the Bridge Model View is updated to reflect the current project data. 
 With the exception of the application of user-defined loads, we are done 
 with the input.</p>
