============

Background
----------
The TOGA plug-in is installed with the main PGSuper installation when the TxDOT options are selected . TOGA itself is part of the TxDOTAgent.dll which is installed in the same folder with PGSuper's files.

> Tip: The default installation folder for PGSuper is "C:\Program Files\WSDOT\PGSuper". However, this location can be changed by the user at installation time.

TOGA Configuration Folder
-------------------------
During installation, a subfolder called "TogaTemplates" is created below the PGSuper installation folder. This folder contains the file TogaTemplate.pgs (which defines the PGSuper Template Bridge), and the *.togt templates files used to define the available beam types for TOGA.

Refer to the links below for more information about the TOGA configuration files.
