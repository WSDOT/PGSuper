============

Background
----------
The TOGA application is installed with the main BridgeLink installation when the TxDOT Extensions are selected . TOGA itself is part of the TxDOTAgent.dll which is installed in the same folder with BridgeLink's files.

> Tip: The default installation folder for BridgeLink is "C:\Program Files\WSDOT\BridgeLink". However, this location may be changed by the user at installation time.

Customizing TOGA
-----------------
Although much of TOGA's behavior is hard-coded in C++, the program can be extended to use new girder types and take advantage of PGSuper's library settings through the use of configuration files. Refer to the links below for more information about the TOGA configuration files.
