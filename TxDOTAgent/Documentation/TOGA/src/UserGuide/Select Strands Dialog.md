Select Strands Dialog {#ui_select_strands_dialog}
===================
This dialog allows direct filling of strand locations when the Non-Standard Direct Strand Fill of Straight Strands option is selected. The dialog can be activated from the Girder Input tab when Non-Standard Direct Strand Fill of Straight Strands is selected.

Strands may be filled (or unfilled) by clicking on the strand location in the girder schematic, or by clicking on the Select check box in the grid.

Debondable strands may be debonded by clicking on the Debond check box in the grid and then entering a debond location as measured from the ends of the girder.
