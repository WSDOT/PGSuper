# PGSuper/PGSplice

PGSuper and PGSplice are [BridgeLink](https://github.com/WSDOT/BridgeLink) applications for the design, analysis, and load rating of pretensioned and post-tensioned spliced concrete bridge girders.

## Getting Started

PSGuper and PGSplice extend the capabilities of the [BridgeLink](https://github.com/WSDOT/BridgeLink) bridge engineering suite of tools by adding design, analysis, and load rating capabilities for precast/prestressed concrete bridge girders.  This repository holds the source code for PGSuper/PGSplice. If you are looking to download and use PGSuper and PGSplice, download and install the BridgeLink bridge engineering suite from [WSDOT](http://www.wsdot.wa.gov) at [http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/eesc/bridge/software](http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/eesc/bridge/software).
